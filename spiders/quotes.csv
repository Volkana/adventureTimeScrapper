Be More/Transcript ,"<dd>[<i>Episode starts at <a href=""/wiki/Finn"" title=""Finn"">Finn</a> and <a href=""/wiki/Jake"" title=""Jake"">Jake</a>'s <a href=""/wiki/Tree_Fort"" title=""Tree Fort"">Tree Fort</a>. <a href=""/wiki/BMO"" title=""BMO"">BMO</a> climbs into a dark room with assorted objects.</i>]
</dd>,<dd><b>BMO</b>:  Hello?
</dd>,<dd>[<i>BMO climbs down a ladder to get into the room. He finds a cardboard box and hides underneath it. He starts chuckling. On his screen, a digital hand selects some files. The hand drags the files into an onscreen trash can, deleting them. BMO's screen glitches, and BMO seems woozy. He chuckles and then looks normal. Scene switches to outside of the box. We hear BMO doing the same act once more and then BMO gets out of the box. He still seems dizzy. We see him selecting the file ""CORE SYSTEM DRIVES.sys"" and then deleting it. The scene shows his face, which turns from a smile into a frown. BMO's screen glitches out wildly as BMO moans. BMO gets up and wanders around for a second, before falling over. The screen is blank.</i>]
</dd>,<dd><b>Finn</b>:  BMO?
</dd>,<dd>[<i>Scene shows Finn and Jake looking down at something. The image is distorted.</i>]
</dd>,<dd><b>Jake</b>:  BMO?
</dd>,<dd>[<i>BMO is lying in a bed. BMO wakes up.</i>]
</dd>,<dd><b>Finn</b>:  BMO, are you okay?
</dd>,<dd><b>Jake</b>:  What did you do?
</dd>,<dd><b>BMO</b>:  It wasn't me. I didn't do noth- do noth- do nothing. [<i>BMO repeats 'do noth-' because of his system glitching.</i>]
</dd>,<dd><b>Finn</b>:  Come on BMO. We got to get you to the hospital or whatevs.
</dd>,<dd><b>BMO</b>:  No, no. I am fine. Really. [<i>BMO's screen glitches out and BMO yells in pain. He emits smoke and stops glitching.</i>] Oh, yes. Okay. Please take me to get fixed. I need- need- need- need to get new core system drivers installed. We can get them at the <a href=""/wiki/MO_Co."" title=""MO Co."">MO Factory</a> in the <a href=""/wiki/Bad_Lands"" title=""Bad Lands"">Bad Lands</a>, where I was born.
</dd>,<dd><b>Finn</b>: The MO Factory?
</dd>,<dd><b>BMO</b>:  Yeah. I am programmed with emergency instructions to get there. Come on! There's no- no- no- no- no time to lo- lo- lo- lo- lose.
</dd>,<dd>[<i>Scene changes to Bad Lands, just outside the MO Co. BMO is telling Finn and Jake where to go.</i>]
</dd>,<dd><b>BMO</b>: Okay. Now straight down this place. Okay, now take a right- right- right- right- left up here. The instructions also say that damaged MOs get a full memory-wipe before repairs. Don't let on what happened... or all the years we've been spent together will vanish like tears in the oven!
</dd>,<dd><b>Finn</b>: Tears in the oven? [<i>gloomy sounds</i>] But memories are real, real cruc'[<i>ial</i>]!
</dd>,<dd><b>BMO</b>:  Yeah, no fooling. Oh wait, there's more! It says here only MOs are allowed in the factory. Wait what? Oh, that's just <i>great</i>.
</dd>,<dd><b>Jake</b>:  Hey, hey. Don't worry buddy. We're Finn and Jake, remember? Or should I say... [<i>Jake transforms into a MO.</i>] Finn and JMO!
</dd>,<dd><b>BMO</b>:  [<i>laughs</i>] Wow!
</dd>,<dd><b>Finn</b>:  Hey BMO, check this out, too! [<i>Finn puts his backpack on BMO's arms. He pulls his arms into his sleeves and pulls his shirt up over his head and over BMO's legs, making it seem like Finn has BMO for a head.</i>] Meet FMO.
</dd>,<dd><b>BMO</b>: Finn, you're dumb- you're dumb- you're dumb- you're da man! This is gonna be a snap!
</dd>,<dd>[<i>Scene changes to inside of the entrance of the MO factory. Finn falls over.</i>]
</dd>,<dd><b>Jake</b>:  Hello, there.
</dd>,<dd><b>DMO</b>:  Greetings, and welcome to MO Co. I'm <a href=""/wiki/DMO"" title=""DMO"">DMO</a>. Please state your business.
</dd>,<dd><b>Jake</b>:  Hey there, DMO. I am JMO.
</dd>,<dd><b>Finn</b>:  And I'm FMO!
</dd>,<dd><b>DMO</b>:  Greetings, JMO. FMO, you look ridiculous. Are you damaged? Are you in need of repair?
</dd>,<dd><b>Finn</b>:  Yes, absolutely. Thanks, DMO. I busted my core system drivers, and now I need new ones.
</dd>,<dd><b>DMO</b>:  Fantastic. Okay. Please get ready for your total personality wipe.
</dd>,<dd>[<i>A hole opens in the wall beside DMO and an EMO comes out, twirling a lasso.</i>]
</dd>,<dd><b>Finn</b>:  Oh, right, right. Uh, right. I mean, no. I'm just here for the... nostalgic purposes.
</dd>,<dd><b>DMO</b>:  Ah, yes. 47.3% of MOs eventually return to the factory for assorted sentimental biz. Please step 100% on the ultra-tram for your complimentary tour.
</dd>,<dd>[<i>Finn and Jake step onto the tram. DMO is lowered from his original position, and a chair pops up on the tram, bringing up DMO to the driver seat.</i>]
</dd>,<dd><b>DMO</b>:  Greetings. [<i>He starts the tram.</i>]
</dd>,<dd><b>Finn</b>:  Wup!
</dd>,<dd><b>DMO</b>:  We are now passing over the famous factory floor. Birthplace of each and every MO. Behold the gleaming machinery! Teeming and wild with the throes of real creation. From this unlikely chaos emerges every shiny new MO.
</dd>,<dd><b>Jake</b>:  But nothing's moving down there. It's all shut down. What happened to this place?
</dd>,<dd><b>DMO</b>:  I'm sorry. I'm just a tram MO. I'm not programmed to understand that question. Also, you're just a JMO. You're not programmed to <i>ask</i> that question.
</dd>,<dd><b>Jake</b>:  Uh, what question?
</dd>,<dd><b>DMO</b>:  That question- [<i>grunts with frustration</i>]
</dd>,<dd><b>Jake</b>:  I'm serious...
</dd>,<dd><b>DMO</b>:  Anyway, MO Co. was founded over 1,000 years ago. By <a href=""/wiki/Moe"" title=""Moe"">Moseph Mastro Giovanni</a>. A sad and gentle man. Beloved by only those he built to belove him. On your left, you'll see the core system driver installation port bay.
</dd>,<dd><b>BMO</b>:  [<i>gasps</i>] Finn! Finn! That's it! That's where the driver ports are!
</dd>,<dd><b>Finn</b>:  I know, I heard!
</dd>,<dd>[<i>Finn jumps off of the tram and into the room along with Jake.</i>]
</dd>,<dd><b>DMO</b>:  What?! Are you crazy?! Get back here!
</dd>,<dd>[<i>The room has outlets in the back of the wall. They each correspond to a different MO from AMO-GMO. The B port is covered up.</i>]
</dd>,<dd><b>Jake</b>:  Hurry, Finn. I think he's calling the police or somethin'!
</dd>,<dd><b>Finn</b>:  None of these ports fit right! E, D, C, where's the B port?!
</dd>,<dd>[<i>Outside of the room where the trams travel, a new tram drives up, carrying four <a href=""/wiki/SMO"" title=""SMO"">SMOs</a>.</i>]
</dd>,<dd><b>SMO 1</b>:  Intruder spotted! Prepare to vaporize! Vaporize!
</dd>,<dd>[<i>The four SMOs shoot lasers into the room. Finn and Jake jump behind some wreckage to protect themselves.</i>
</dd>,<dd><b>SMO 1</b>:  Cease fire! No intruder spotted. Vaporization complete.
</dd>,<dd><b>SMO 2</b>:  Um, but what if they slipped past us, sir? In all the smoke?
</dd>,<dd><b>SMO 1</b>:  Allllright, everyone. About face. [<i>All four SMOs turn around.</i>] Does anyone see the intruders now? [<i>The other three SMOs look around as the first SMO looks annoyed.</i>] Like I <i>said</i>, vaporization complete. Now let's head back to base. It's donut o' clock.
</dd>,<dd>[<i>Scene changes to a kind of office kitchen. There is a table with chairs, a vending machine, a refrigerator and a microwave.</i>]
</dd>,<dd><b>SMO 3</b>:  Man, how about those goofs? Tryin' to mess with our drivers?
</dd>,<dd><b>SMO 4</b>:  Yeah. You know the world these days. All goofs. [<i>SMO 4 takes his gun and gets donuts out of the vending machine with it.</i>]
</dd>,<dd><b>SMO 1</b>:  Hey! You toss me one of them 'nuts? [<i>SMO 4 tosses him a donut while SMO 3 pours coffee on his screen, as if to drink it.</i>] Ah. Yeah, hey, speaking of goofs? Haven't seen SMO 5681 lately.
</dd>,<dd><b>SMO 3</b>:  [<i>while rubbing a coffee mug on his side</i>] Man, that goof.
</dd>,<dd><b>SMO 1</b>:  Yeah, I hate that goof. [<i>SMO 1 rubs the donut on his screen like he is eating it.</i>] You ever notice goofs always askin' how you're doin'? What is that? Uh, yeah, I'm fine.
</dd>,<dd><b>SMO 3</b>:  Yeah, 100%.
</dd>,<dd>[<i>SMO 4 tries to throw donuts straight from the bag into his mouth, but they keep hitting the screen and falling to the floor. From somewhere in the room, the sound of feet walking gets SMO 1's attention.</i>]
</dd>,<dd><b>SMO 1</b>:  Oh! Hey, what are you doing over there by yourself?
</dd>,<dd>[<i>An SMO with an orange screen and orange legs turns around.</i>]
</dd>,<dd><b>SMO 5</b>:  Uh, oh, I-- I'm sad.
</dd>,<dd><b>SMO 1</b>:  Oh, yeah, y'know we've all been there. [<i>to the other SMOs:</i>] So anyway, how's your goofy wife doin'?
</dd>,<dd>[<i>The scene pans over to SMO 5. We see the inside of SMO 5, which is really just Finn, BMO, and Jake hiding inside an SMO shell. They are using Jake as the face and legs of the SMO.</i>]
</dd>,<dd><b>Finn</b>:  [<i>whispering:</i>] BMO, how are you doing?
</dd>,<dd><b>BMO</b>:  Get me close to that guy's port. I can hack into his computer and find out where my driver port is! [<i>BMO's screen shows him barfing.</i>]
</dd>,<dd><b>Jake</b>:  Ah, we gotta hustle!
</dd>,<dd><b>SMO 1</b>:  [<i>in response to something someone else said:</i>] Yeah, pretty good, I guess. I prefer something yeastier. The wife is always giving me grief about that. But I mean, what am I, decent?
</dd>,<dd>[<i>Inside the SMO shell, while SMO 1 is talking, Jake takes a cord from BMO and plugs it into the back of SMO 1. Suddenly, SMO 1's face is shocked and is then frozen as BMO accesses the file ""MAP.MO"". He starts shaking.</i>]
</dd>,<dd><b>SMO 4</b>:  Hey, what are you two goofs doin'? Goofing?
</dd>,<dd>[<i>We see inside the SMO shell again, and we see the map on BMO's screen. The map scrolls down to the bottom.</i>]
</dd>,<dd><b>Jake</b>:  Dang, man, how deep does this place go?
</dd>,<dd><b>Finn</b>:  Down, right, left, down, corkscrew, down. [<i>memorizing it:</i>] Down, right, left, down, corkscrew, down.
</dd>,<dd>[<i>They throw down SMO 1 and jump out of the shell.</i>]
</dd>,<dd><b>Finn</b>:  Psych! [<i>Finn, Jake, and BMO start running away.</i>]
</dd>,<dd><b>SMO 3</b>:  Hey, woah!
</dd>,<dd>[<i>The three get to a metal grate.</i>]
</dd>,<dd><b>Finn</b>:  Down that grate!
</dd>,<dd>[<i>Jake breaks it and they go under it. We see seven SMOs after them, telling them to stop. The scene changes to below the grate. The three fall down perfectly timed with the tram, driven by DMO. They land right on top of it. They look behind them and see an SMO poking his head out of the ceiling.</i>]
</dd>,<dd><b>DMO</b>:  Hey! Only MOs are allowed in the facility 1,000%! [<i>DMO walks down to where Finn, Jake, and BMO are.</i>] Get off of my tram!
</dd>,<dd><b>Jake</b>:  Cram your tram! [<i>Jake minimizes to DMO's size. He runs over and kicks DMO off of the tram.</i>] Womp!
</dd>,<dd>[<i>Finn turns to look at him and gives smiles at him, raising his fists in the air. Jake pulls a lever by the driver's seat, making them go even faster. Finn laughs and looks down at BMO.</i>]
</dd>,<dd><b>Finn</b>:  Hang in there, BMO!
</dd>,<dd>[<i>BMO flashes a weak thumbs up on his screen.</i>]
</dd>,<dd><b>Finn</b>:  Hey, Jake! Can this thing go any fast-
</dd>,<dd>[<i>Finn is interrupted by an explosion behind him. He and BMO are thrown to the front of the tram.</i>]
</dd>,<dd><b>Finn</b>:  Woah! Shoot, it's the fuzz!
</dd>,<dd>[<i>Behind them, a tram with ten SMOs and DMO is following them.</i>]
</dd>,<dd><b>DMO</b>:  Hit 'em again!
</dd>,<dd>[<i>The SMOs shoot the tram. Almost half of the tram is gone.</i>]
</dd>,<dd><b>Finn</b>:  Holy-
</dd>,<dd><b>Jake</b>:  Finn, how are we getting to BMO's driver port?!
</dd>,<dd><b>Finn</b>:  Uh, turn right!
</dd>,<dd>[<i>Jake turns the tram right. The SMOs tram continues forward, but using a shortcut, they get behind them again.</i>]
</dd>,<dd><b>Finn</b>:  Dog it, they're still behind us! [""They drive through a 2D DNA-like path. Unlike a strand of DNA, there is only one looping part. Finn and Jake are driving in a straight line down the middle of the 'DNA' as the SMOs tram loops around them.<i>]</i>
</dd>,<dd><b>Finn</b>:  Turn left!
</dd>,<dd>[<i>They drive through a road beneath another. The SMO's tram goes on the top road.</i>]
</dd>,<dd><b>Finn</b>:  Turn <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roller_coaster_elements#Corkscrew"" class=""extiw"" title=""wikipedia:Roller coaster elements"">Corkscrew</a>!
</dd>,<dd>[<i>They now drive in a 3D DNA-like path. This time, there </i>is<i> two curves. The two trams loop around each other. Eventually, they merge into one track.</i>]
</dd>,<dd><b>Finn</b>:  Now go down!
</dd>,<dd>[<i>Jake makes the tram face completely downward. Finn, Jake, and BMO fall off. Jake stretches into a shield below them. They break through three different floors. One room has a B port, but they fall too quickly.</i>]
</dd>,<dd><b>Finn</b>:  There's a driver port!
</dd>,<dd>[<i>In the last room they fall through, Jake turns into a parachute. They land on the floor of a huge, white room. Finn and Jake groan with their pains from falling.</i>]
</dd>,<dd><b>Finn</b>:  Too spicy.
</dd>,<dd><b>Jake</b>:  My bod!
</dd>,<dd>[<i>Behind them, ten SMOs and DMO from the tram fall through the ceiling, crashing on top of one another.</i>]
</dd>,<dd><b>SMO 6</b>:  Non-MOs are forbidden in this facility!
</dd>,<dd><b>BMO</b>:  [<i>weakly:</i>] I am not non-MO.
</dd>,<dd>[<i>SMO 6 still charges his laser gun</i>]
</dd>,<dd><b>BMO</b>:  [<i>louder:</i>] I am BMO!
</dd>,<dd>[<i>SMO 6 shoots his laser at the ceiling so he doesn't shoot anybody.</i>]
</dd>,<dd><b>SMO 6</b>:  [<i>whispering, in awe:</i>] BMO.
</dd>,<dd>[<i>A light flashes in the faces of the SMOs.</i>]
</dd>,<dd><b>Moe</b>:  BMO? Did I hear BMO?
</dd>,<dd><b>Jake</b>:  Wait, what's up?
</dd>,<dd>[<i>We see the lights are coming from a room with MMO and Moe. MMO takes Moe out of his chair and cradles him. MMO carries him down to where Finn, Jake, the SMOs and where DMO is, with little unknown MOs trailing behind, holding life support equipment and tools</i>]
</dd>,<dd><b>Moe</b>:  Hey, I'm Moe! [<i>Moe taps MMO twice on the head. MMO drops him. Moe laughs.</i>] Don't worry! My legs don't work!
</dd>,<dd><b>Finn</b>:  You're Moe?! Wait, are you human, too?
</dd>,<dd><b>Moe</b>:  My skin is human!
</dd>,<dd><b>Jake</b>:  Dude, how old are you?!
</dd>,<dd><b>Moe</b>:  Hey, come on, now! [<i>Moe crawls over to where BMO is. He turns him so BMO is sitting down.</i>] It <i>is</i> BMO! Looks like there's some software problems! [<i>Moe turns BMO off. He opens his face plate. He looks at the inside of him with a frown.</i>] Hmm.
</dd>,<dd><b>Finn</b>:  So...you made BMO?
</dd>,<dd><b>Jake</b>:  [<i>Jake stretches to a large size.</i>] Hey, you're not gonna reset our friend's personality, are you?
</dd>,<dd><b>Moe</b>:  Huh? What? No...BMO's one of a kind. I built BMO to take care of my son. [<i>A <a href=""/wiki/CMO"" title=""CMO"">CMO</a> brings over a screwdriver.</i>] Oh, thank you. But I guess I never ended up dating any women. So, that's sad. [<i>Moe chuckles.</i>] I sent BMO off into the world alone. [<i>Moe coughs a couple of times while saying:</i>] Hoping to find a family home. And then maybe even find somebody else's little boy to take care of.
</dd>,<dd><b>Finn</b>:  Aw.
</dd>,<dd><b>Moe</b>:  Oh, there's that back-up driver disk! [<i>A CMO is holding a small floppy disk.</i>] Thank you. [<i>The CMO gives him the OK sign and smiles.</i>] [<i>Moe puts the disk drive into a slot in BMO. Some lights flash. The system shoots the disk back out.</i>] That oughta done it. I must've built what, like, a million MOs. But BMO is very, very special. I built BMO to understand fun. And how to <i>play</i>. [<i>extends an arm and something makes a cracking sound</i>] You see, I made BMO to be more. [<i>Moe turns BMO on.</i>]
</dd>,<dd><b>BMO</b>:  Ooh! Are you my grandpoop?
</dd>,<dd><b>Moe</b>:  Nah, I'm just your poop.
</dd>,<dd>[<i>BMO gasps and runs up to Moe to give him a hug.</i>]
</dd>,<dd><b>Jake</b>:  Wait, did you say you built a million robots?
</dd>,<dd><b>Finn</b>:  Yeah, all we saw was that tram jerk and all those jerky security jerks!
</dd>,<dd><b>Moe</b>:  Ah, those were just the surface jerks. [<i>to MMO:</i>] Up, please. [<i>MMO lifts him up over himself. He carries him over to a porthole in the ground with a wheel.</i>] Kid, come over here. [<i>He turns the wheel and the scene shows what's inside. There are a couple hundred MOs milling about. We see a QMO watering plants, an unknown MO with wings, two LMOs throwing dice and money, two CMOs playing jump rope with an OMO while a WMO, PMO, and three ♥MOs looking at them.</i>] BMO, say hello to your family.
</dd>,<dd><b>BMO</b>:  Hello, family.
</dd>,<dd>[<i>All of the MOs turn up to look at him.</i>]
</dd>,<dd><b>MOs</b>:  Hi, BMO!
</dd>,<dd>[<i>BMO puts his hands on his smiling face.</i>]

</dd>,<dd>[<i>Inside the <a href=""/wiki/Tree_Fort"" title=""Tree Fort"">Tree Fort</a>, <a href=""/wiki/BMO"" title=""BMO"">BMO</a>, under a couch, plays a game on its own screen with a joystick.</i>]
</dd>,<dd><b>BMO</b>:  Haha! Take that, Master Chen!
</dd>,<dd>[<i>Footsteps are heard. <a href=""/wiki/Finn"" title=""Finn"">Finn</a>'s feet, one of them missing a sock, pass near BMO.</i>]
</dd>,<dd><b>Finn</b>:  <a href=""/wiki/Jake"" title=""Jake"">JAAAAKE</a>!
</dd>,<dd><b>Jake</b>:  What?
</dd>,<dd>[<i>BMO notices Finn and quits playing its game. BMO sneaks up near Finn, who is rummaging through boots. Its joystick, still connected, follows him.</i>]
</dd>,<dd><b>Finn</b>:  Jake, did you hide my sock?
</dd>,<dd><b>Jake [<i>Offscreen</i>]</b>:  No, man, I told you,
</dd>,<dd>[<i>Jake is shown putting eyeliner and looking at a mirror.</i>]
</dd>,<dd><b>Jake</b>:  I don't do that kinda stuff anymore.
</dd>,<dd><b>Finn</b>:  So, what? It just magically disappeared?
</dd>,<dd><b>Jake</b>:  I don't know...
</dd>,<dd>[<i>Jake makes a spiral mark with lipstick on his face</i>]
</dd>,<dd><b>Jake</b>:  Maybe.
</dd>,<dd>[<i>Finn gets up and walks towards Jake</i>]
</dd>,<dd><b>Finn</b>:  Is that just a cute way of saying you took it?
</dd>,<dd><b>Jake</b>:  <i>No!</i>
</dd>,<dd><b>Finn</b>:  Why don't you just help me find my sock?
</dd>,<dd><b>Jake</b>:  [<i>Sarcastically</i>] Oh, Finn lost his sock! Everybody stop what you're doing and help Finn find his precious sock!
</dd>,<dd>[<i>Film turns to black and white as BMO performs its action</i>]
</dd>,<dd>[<i>BMO, having watched the conversation, pulls out its joystick cable and steps on it, twisting its foot (like it's putting out a cigarette). A cigarette burn is heard. Jazz music begins to play. Finn and Jake's voices get silent.</i>]
</dd>,<dd><b>BMO</b>:  [<i>Voiceover</i>] It looked like a tough case to crack. But I hate to see good friends fight.
</dd>,<dd>[<i>Zoom to BMO's face lighted in the eye region</i>]
</dd>,<dd><b>BMO</b>:  [<i>V.O.</i>] So I decided to take the case.
</dd>,<dd>[<i>Finn and Jake leave, but a flash reveals that BMO has taken a photo. He picks up the polaroid and looks at it.</i>]
</dd>,<dd><b>BMO</b>:  [<i>V.O.</i>] Hmm... [<i>Gasps.</i>]
</dd>,<dd>[<i>Cut to the picture. A mouse rests next to Finn's foot.</i>]
</dd>,<dd><b>BMO</b>:  [<i>V.O.</i>] <i><a href=""/wiki/Ronnie"" title=""Ronnie"">Ronnie</a></i>!
</dd>,<dd>[<i>BMO pulls down the picture, revealing Ronnie, who looks at it and runs away.</i>]
</dd>,<dd><b>BMO</b>:  [<i>V.O.</i>] It looked like I had a guilty mouse.
</dd>,<dd>[<i>BMO runs towards where Ronnie ran. A chase scene ensues. Ronnie climbs up the wood structure of the Tree Fort.</i>]
</dd>,<dd><b>BMO</b>:  [<i>Gasps.</i>]
</dd>,<dd>[<i>BMO sees a hole in a tree nearby.</i>]
</dd>,<dd><b>BMO</b>:  Huh!
</dd>,<dd>[<i>BMO dives into the hole. Ronnie climbs down the wood structure and heads to the table, but BMO traps him.</i>]
</dd>,<dd><b>BMO</b>:  Hello, Ronnie.
</dd>,<dd>[<i>BMO sticks out its hand at Ronnie's lips and moves them.</i>]
</dd>,<dd><b>BMO [<i>As Ronnie, deeper voice</i>]</b>:  What do you want, BMO?
</dd>,<dd>[<i>BMO releases its hand out of Ronnie's lips. Ronnie lifts his head up.</i>]
</dd>,<dd><b>BMO</b>:  Where is Finn's sock?
</dd>,<dd><b>BMO [<i>As Ronnie</i>]</b>:  I don't know what you're talking about, BMO. I didn't do nothin'. Leave me alone!
</dd>,<dd>[<i>Ronnie puts his head down, revealing a lipstick smudge on the back of his neck. Zoom to the smudge. BMO's face is lighted.</i>]
</dd>,<dd><b>BMO</b>:  [<i>V.O.</i>] I knew that lipstick anywhere. [<i>BMO closes its eyes on ""anywhere""</i>]
</dd>,<dd><b>BMO</b>:  [<i>Speaking</i>] How is <a href=""/wiki/Lorraine"" title=""Lorraine"">Lorraine</a>?
</dd>,<dd>[<i>Ronnie turns his head at BMO.</i>]
</dd>,<dd><b>BMO [<i>As Ronnie</i>]</b>:  You stay away from her! She is with me now, do you hear?
</dd>,<dd><b>BMO</b>:  Calm down, big guy. Me and Lorraine are dinosaur bones.
</dd>,<dd><b>BMO [<i>As Ronnie</i>]</b>:  Good, 'cause I would be <i>so</i> jealous.
</dd>,<dd>[<i>BMO shows its picture to Ronnie, who looks at it.</i>]
</dd>,<dd><b>BMO</b>:  Just tell me where the sock is, and I will let you go.
</dd>,<dd>[<i>Zoom to the picture and Ronnie.</i>]
</dd>,<dd><b>BMO [<i>As Ronnie</i>]</b>:  I don't know, man.
</dd>,<dd>[<i>BMO shakes its fist and leans towards him.</i>]
</dd>,<dd><b>BMO</b>:  What if I put some knuckle in your eyeballs? Would that help you think?
</dd>,<dd><b>BMO [<i>As Ronnie</i>]</b>:  Ok! Ok! Umm...
</dd>,<dd>[<i>BMO grabs Ronnie's arm and points to Finn's foot, where a stain is seen.</i>]
</dd>,<dd><b>BMO [<i>As Ronnie</i>]</b>: It looks like a grape juice stain on his sock; check the pantry.
</dd>,<dd><b>BMO</b>:  [<i>V.O.</i>] Of course I didn't trust Ronnie, but I had no other leads. [<i>goes in the pantry</i>] Maybe the grape juice had some secrets to tell me. Or maybe Ronnie was just pulling my hair. 
</dd>,<dd><b>BMO</b>:  [<i>climbed up to where the grape juice was</i>]
</dd>,<dd><b>BMO</b>:  [<i>V.O.</i>] Just as I thought, not even opened. I fell right into his trap.
</dd>,<dd><b>BMO</b>:  [<i>pantry door closed</i>] [<i>Gasps</i>] Let me out, you! I'll get you! Piece of... you! Ronnie! [<i>the door opens and BMO falls on its face</i>] <a href=""/wiki/Cats#Officer_Davis"" title=""Cats"">Officer Davis</a>! Thank goodness. I... 
</dd>,<dd><b>BMO [<i>as Officer Davis</i>]</b>:  BMO, what are you doing here?
</dd>,<dd><b>BMO</b>:  Looking for Finn's socks, same as you.
</dd>,<dd><b>BMO [<i>as Officer Davis</i>]</b>:  We got this to under control. [<i>licks his hand</i>] Stay out of police business, or you will be the one behind bars.
</dd>,<dd><b>BMO</b>:  [<i>V.O.</i>] [<i>climbing up a ladder</i>] I didn't listen to that cop. I needed to find Ronnie, and I knew just the lady who could lead me to him. [<i>at the top was Lorraine's house</i>] She looked as beautiful as ever.
</dd>,<dd><b>BMO</b>:  Where is the sock, Lorraine? 
</dd>,<dd><b>BMO [<i>as Lorraine</i>]</b>:  What makes you think I know? 
</dd>,<dd><b>BMO</b>:  I saw your lipstick on his fur, so don't act so cute. 
</dd>,<dd><b>BMO [<i>as Lorraine</i>]</b>:  Sounds like someone's jealous, no?
</dd>,<dd><b>BMO</b>:  Don't count on it, Lorraine. Now tell me where Ronnie is.
</dd>,<dd><b>BMO [<i>as Lorraine</i>]</b>:  Ha! You think it was Ronnie? Maybe if he was man enough to steal a sock, I wouldn't have to spend my nights with <a href=""/wiki/Bebe"" title=""Bebe"">Bebe</a>.
</dd>,<dd><b>BMO</b>:  Bebe? So you're saying Bebe is man enough?
</dd>,<dd><b>BMO [<i>as Lorraine</i>]</b>:  What? No, you're putting words in my mouth. Bebe doesn't know anything about Finn's sock.
</dd>,<dd><b>BMO</b>:  [<i>Gasps</i>] Finn's sock? How did you know it was Finn's sock? I never said whose sock was stolen, Lorraine.
</dd>,<dd><b>BMO [<i>as Lorraine</i>]</b>:  Uh... uh... I heard it on the TV news.
</dd>,<dd><b>BMO</b>:  No dice, sweet beak. Officer Davis has this case under tight wraps.

</dd>,<dd><b>Princess Bubblegum</b>: [<i>exhales</i>] Ladies and gentlemen, I have invented time travel.

[<i>slips on the gloves and lifts the sphere</i>] I made special gloves for it.
</dd>,<dd>[<i>Finn gives a thumbs up.</i>]
</dd>,<dd><b>Princess Bubblegum</b>: [<i>places the sphere around two small creatures</i>] Now check it out! It's logging time.
</dd>,<dd>[<i>The creatures blabber indistinctly as one drinks from a thimble. It sprays the drink upward into a mist and starts kissing the other one as the mist falls over them. They then continue blabbering.</i>]

</dd>,<dd>[<i>The two creatures back away as they watch their past selves rewind.</i>]
</dd>,<dd><b>Princess Bubblegum</b>: Now I'll push the time travel button.
</dd>,<dd>[<i>The two creatures scream as their molecules reset to where they were when the sphere was first placed around them. They continue blabbering.</i>]
</dd>,<dd><b>Jake</b>: Eh... It's not really time travel, though. You just, you know, moved their stuff around. You didn't really manipulate time. <a href=""/wiki/Ice_King"" title=""Ice King"">Ice King</a>'s done it better before... with magic.

</dd>,<dd><b>Finn</b>:  Uh, Jake, can't we get rid of these Clown Nurses? They make me feel ridiculous.

</dd>,<dd><b>Jake</b>:  No way, man.

</dd>,<dd><b>Jake</b>:  Well, now you know we can't jump off of birds. [<i>The fat Clown Nurse waves a cookie around, mimicking airplane sounds and plops it into Jake's mouth.</i>] I paid them up front. They don't leave until the job's done. Besides...

</dd>,<dd><b>Head Clown Nurse</b>:  Maybe you should leave the medical decisions to the medical professionals, and my professional prescription is... your toe needs crazy smooches! It's the only way! [<i>laughs</i>]

</dd>,<dd><b>Finn</b>:  MY WAY!!
</dd>,<dd>[<i>He runs out of the house and into the forest, screaming. He finally comes to a stop. He's staring at a tree stump with a sign. The road splits up into two paths.</i>]
</dd>,<dd><b>Finn</b>:  Hmmm...

</dd>,<dd><b>Finn</b>:  NO! I choose MY WAY!! [<i>He kicks the sign off of her head.</i>] My way.
</dd>,<dd>[<i>Finn runs right through the prickly bushes, screaming all the way. He comes out on the other side, all scratched and covered in thorns. He then comes across a river an walks up to the bank. A bush is on the bank nearby.</i>]

</dd>,<dd><b>Finn</b>:  Wha...? [<i>Beats</i>] I need to cross the <a href=""/wiki/Acid_River"" title=""Acid River"">river</a>. The Cyclops is over there.
</dd>,<dd><b>Bush</b>:  You can't cross this river. It's impossible! Look! The current is so fast, it'll turn your butt inside-out for real, doofus. And the water's so acidic it'll crump your boat in half. It's like orange juice. It's gross. There's a <a href=""/wiki/Trap_Bridge"" title=""Trap Bridge"">bridge</a>, but it's a trap!

</dd>,<dd>[<i>While the bush speaks, the camera shows the river's current flowing, and the steaming hull of a boat that was corroded away.

</dd>,<dd><b>Finn</b>:  But I need to get across.
</dd>,<dd><b>Bush</b>:  Listen what I'm telling you. There's no way. ...Ugly tramp.

</dd>,<dd><b>Finn</b>:  MY WAY!!
</dd>,<dd>[<i>A screaming Finn then charges head-on into the river, using the bush to sweep the water off of the ground beneath. The bush is screaming in pain all the while. Then some electric eels jump out of the water and wrap themselves around Finn, shocking him and singing off the bush's leaves. Finn finally stops on a rock and the eels come off of him. Finn spits out a glob of vomit into the water.</i>]
</dd>,<dd><b>Bush</b>:  Glibby glob, man! You're crazy! We're not even half way across! You gotta go back, man! It's the only way, you ugly fat-smelling fat-head!
</dd>,<dd><b>Finn</b>:  NO, MY WAY!! [<i>Frustrated, Finn tosses the now-barren bush all the way across the river. Then he dives in.

</dd>,<dd><b>Finn</b>:  [<i>panting</i>] MY WAY! [<i>He quenches the acid by smashing one of the melons over his head.</i>] Oh, Glob, oh, Glob, oh, Glob, oh, Glob.

</dd>,<dd>[<i>Still frustrated as ever, Finn pushes Pan aside and picks up the wagon.</i>]
</dd>,<dd><b>Finn</b>:  [<i>panting</i>] MY WAY! [<i>He hurls the wagon down the hill. The wagon shatters as it hits the ground, and the melons tumble down the hill.</i>]
</dd>,<dd><b>Pan</b>:  Watch out, Rainy!
</dd>,<dd>[<i>Rainy realizes too late. She avoids the first one, which rolls over the wigwam house, but the others roll over her, injuring her. Rainy groans in pain.</i>]

</dd>,<dd><b>Finn</b>:  Uh... wh... I... [<i>sighs</i>]
</dd>,<dd><b>Pan</b>:  Psycho fink.
</dd>,<dd>[<i>Finn walks uphill to a cliff overlooking the valley below. He realizes his plan didn't go as well as he had hoped. He takes off his hat and <a href=""/wiki/Melons"" title=""Melons"">breaks out in song</a>.</i>]
</dd>,<dd><b>Finn</b>:  ♫ I was wrong. Was I wrong? No. Yes... Yes... I was wrong. How could it be? I trusted in my guts, but ended up all nuts. I was wrong. How could it be? Listened to my brain, but ended up insane. The melons rolled...over that lady. I went too far. How could it be? [<i>Finn puts his hat back on.</i>] How did I go... too far? ♫
</dd>,<dd>[<i>As Finn finishes his song, the camera zooms out to reveal a little beneath the cliff. A giant eye opens up, looks up, and blinks. Suddenly something hunches up from the cliff. It's the Cyclops Finn has been seeking.</i>]

</dd>,<dd><b>Finn</b>:  No. I hurt a small, hairy man's wife. I just wanna go home.
</dd>,<dd><b>Forest Cyclops</b>:  You're just trying to make me feel sad so you can steal my tears when I cry... but I've got a heart of stone, buddy. I'm EVIL!

</dd>,<dd><b>Y5</b>: What do you know?
</dd>,<dd><b>CGO</b>: Uh, duh. He created me. We go way back, to the real busted last days of Earth. [<i>flashbacks</i>] Hugo had a big brain and a rocket and led an exodus to the stars on the cheap. The Grays warned him about the dangers of bio-hacking their alien style, but Hugo gets his way. Then we were saved by a orb. The Drift was already breaking down when we got here. But after Hugo set up shop, well, he just makes everything worse. I got chucked into the trash. That little service droid went back into space. Poor thing. I wonder if she ever found what she was looking for. [<i>Flashback ends.</i>]  Hugo's a great guy... as long as he thinks you're good for something.
</dd>,<dd>[<i>On hearing this, Y5 squats back and sheds tears silently.</i>]
</dd>,<dd><b>CGO</b>: Hey, quit leaking on my scrap. Fingers crossed. [<i>presses BMO's button</i>] Maybe he needs to warm up a bit.

</dd>,<dd><b>BMO</b>: I said the same thing when I was dying. You saved me. You can save the Drift.
</dd>,<dd><b>Y5</b>: But it's just too much.
</dd>,<dd><b>BMO</b>: Even when things look really, really stupid, we still have to try.

</dd>,<dd><b>Y5</b>: You're donking it all up, Hugo! Do you deny it?
</dd>,<dd><b>Hugo</b>: Nah, it's all true. The Unity Pod was always designed to save only myself and my loyal inner circle. The rest of the Drift is... Well, it's unfortunate collateral damage in the grand scheme of things. Besides, this all can't be on me. Y'all thought the Unity Pod sounded like a sweet deal, as long as you thought you were getting a piece of the pie. But if anyone was offended by my actions, I am truly, truly...

</dd>,<dd><b>Y5's Dad</b>: There's no way to stop the activation process.
</dd>,<dd><b>KS-2</b>: The station's power will be sucked dry!
</dd>,<dd><b>Y5</b>: No! We were so close!
</dd>,<dd><b>BMO</b>: Why don't we just pull the plug? If we remove the plug before it's powered up, it won't turn on.
</dd>,<dd><b>KS-2</b>: The robot is right. The only way we can stop the U-Pod from draining all the juice from the Drift is to eject it.
</dd>,<dd><b>BMO</b>: Yes! Brute force!

</dd>,<dd><b>One of the citizens</b>: [<i>People talk to each other unsettled</i>] Is it too late to get on the U-Pod?
</dd>,<dd><b>Y5</b>: It's true. Most of the station is dead now, and all communications are down. We're going to have to manage the remaining resources to survive. We need to learn how to help each other. I know it's hard, but we have to try, or we won't make it.
</dd>,<dd><b>Sweetie</b>: I'll give it a shot.

</dd>,<dd><b>Star Man</b>: [<i>Shrugs</i>] Uh, yeah, probably, right? [<i>The comet appears through the missiles' dust cloud without getting so much as even a dent</i>] Shoot! No effect! It's still coming right at us!
</dd>,<dd><b>Grob Gob Glob Grod</b>: Was that all of our missiles?
</dd>,<dd><b>Star Man</b>: Uh, yeah, I'm surprised we even had those ones. Like who would we shoot a missile at? Who'd we shoot at?!
</dd>,<dd><b>Grob Gob Glob Grod</b>: [<i>Altogether</i>] I'm <b>thinking</b>, Star Man!
</dd>,<dd><b>Star Man</b>: [<i>Covers his mouth</i>] Rooot!
</dd>,<dd><b>Grob Gob Glob Grod</b>: Grob. Assessment.
</dd>,<dd><b>Grob Gob Glob Grod</b>: We're sunk, bro. This whole place is gonna be a stinkin' molten dump in a minute.
</dd>,<dd><b>Grob Gob Glob Grod</b>: It doesn't make sense. Every 1,000 years, the Catalyst Comet mysteriously reincarnates itself and collides with Earth, bringing with it an agent of change. But the comet has never been so off schedule - and it's never freakin' hit <i>Mars</i>!
</dd>,<dd><b>Grob Gob Glob Grod</b>: What do you think, Finn the Human?
</dd>,<dd><b>Finn</b>: Wha? Who, me? You can see me too?
</dd>,<dd><b>Grob Gob Glob Grod</b>: Yes, I am Glob.
</dd>,<dd><b>Finn</b>: Oh yeah. Hey, do you ever say ""Oh my Glob?""
</dd>,<dd><b>Grob Gob Glob Grod</b>: No, but sometimes Gob does. [<i>They all smile and so does Finn, who laughs</i>] You're dreaming so far from home, it must be comet related.
</dd>,<dd><b>Finn</b>: Yeah, but, I gotta question.
</dd>,<dd><b>Grob Gob Glob Grod</b>: What's that?
</dd>,<dd><b>Finn</b>: Well, if just being born is the greatest act of creation. [shot of Space Lards] Then what are you suppose to do after that? [shot of Mr. Fox looking at the sky] Isn't everything that comes next just sort of a disappointment? [shot of Ice King standing in an empty Cloud Kingdom] Slowly entropy-ing until we deflate into a pile of mush? [shot of Bounce House Princess, now deflated in her panic room with the porcupine continuing to eat]
</dd>,<dd><b>Grob Gob Glob Grod</b>: Well, it’s not enough to have created something amazing, right? What if I just let my Martian supersociety go to butt?
</dd>,<dd><b>Finn</b>: But what's it worth if we're all gonna get blowed up right now? [<i>Grob Gob Glob Grod suddenly takes off into space</i>]
</dd>,<dd><b>Star Man</b>: Whoa! <i><b>What are you doing?!</b></i> [<i>looking through the machine's scope</i>] [<i>Grob Gob Glob Grod head straight at the Comet screaming and crashes into it, sacrificing their synthetic lives for the Red Planet in a blaze of cosmic glory.

</dd>,<dd><b>Finn</b>: Ahhh! [<i>Gasps and wakes up</i>] <b>Oh my bod!</b>
</dd>,<dd><b>Jake</b>: [<i>Wakes up</i>] What is it, boyi?!
</dd>,<dd><b>Finn</b>: ...Glob is dead.
</dd>,<dd>[<i>Above Mars, the fleet of ships saw the explosion</i>]
</dd>,<dd><b>Evacuation Man</b>: [<i>On a walkie-talkie</i>] Hello, Star Man, this is Evacuation Man, what's the sitch, can we go back yet?
</dd>,<dd><b>Star Man</b>: [<i>On walkie-talkie</i>] Yes! Gob Glob Grod Grob diverted the comet, it's back on its normal path to Earth.
</dd>,<dd><b>Evacuation Man</b>: And what about the G-Man?
</dd>,<dd><b>Star Man</b>: No sign of Glob.
</dd>,<dd><b>Evacuation Man</b>: [<i>Takes off his hat and lowers it in respect</i>] [<i>The comet passes by</i>]
</dd>,<dd>[<i>As it appears, the ""comet"" is really a star cruiser... and inside this ship's bridge is Finn's father, Martin.</i>]
</dd>,<dd><b>Martin</b>: Ahh! Computer! What did we hit?! [<i>No good - the computer spouts gibberish then explodes, no doubt from the heavy damage inflicted by Grob Gob Glob Grod's sacrifice.</i>] Oh, blobs...

</dd>,<dd><b>Samantha</b>: But I haven't seen a man-dog in years! And now the universe has dropped one into my arms!
</dd>,<dd><b>Jake</b>: Whoa, lady, no way. This boy's got.

</dd>,<dd><b>Jake</b>: [<i>whispering</i>] No, girl, we can bounce outta here. My friend Finn will save us any second now.

</dd>,<dd><b>Jake</b>: Well, I guess we're gonna have to fight then.
</dd>,<dd>[<i>Samantha yells as she runs towards Jake, and tries to kick him. He dodges as Samantha punches him in the face. She grabs his head, and squishes it down, as Kee-Oth laughs. She throws Jake at a boulder and smashes another boulder into him.</i>]

</dd>,<dd><b>Joshua</b>: That's because I've been drinking so much holy water. It's in my blood, sucka! And naturally, I gotta go to the bathroom like crazy. Be right back!
</dd>,<dd><b>Kee-Oth</b>: If I can't suck you, I'll suck myself's blood.

</dd>,<dd><b>Kee-Oth</b>: Yeah, hahaha! Your circle can't stop my sucking! Now I have your demon blood as well!
</dd>,<dd><b>Finn</b>: Except it's not demon blood! It's a frozen grape juice that was blessed by the priest.
</dd>,<dd><b>Finn</b>: [<i>Flashback to Finn grabbing the sword out of his freezer, and taking over to Shelby to ""bless.""</i>] Bless this sword, fodder.
</dd>,<dd><b>Shelby</b>: Mmm, check please!

</dd>,<dd><b>Samantha</b>: [<i>She starts walking out the door.</i>] Let's fight again some time.
</dd>,<dd><b>Jake</b>: Nah, I'll just stretch into a tree.
</dd>,<dd><b>Samantha</b>: Hmm. Took you long enough to stretch outta that pit. [<i>She runs off.</i>]
</dd>,<dd><b>Lady</b>: 뭐, 뭐가 어떻게 된 거야? 너 저 여자한테 반한 거야 뭐야! (What is happening? Did you fall in love with that lady or what!)
</dd>,<dd><b>Jake</b>: Pshh, please! Not even.
</dd>,<dd><b>Lady</b>: 그럼 그 함정에서 왜 그렇게 오래 버티고 있었어? (Then why did you spend that long time in the pit?)
</dd>,<dd><b>Jake</b>: Uh, because... Kee-Oth was right there! An-and there were traps! I didn't have no blood this whole time, so I'm totally out of it. [<i>He falls to the ground.</i>]

</dd>,<dd><b>Mochi</b>: It's almost too insane.
</dd>,<dd><b>Taffi</b>: Wicked.
</dd>,<dd>[<i>T.V. coughs and splashes desperately before sinking below the water. There's a gurgle, then a giant Justin Rockcandy rises from the moat with T.V. on top of his head.</i>]

</dd>,<dd><b>T.V.</b>: Justin?
</dd>,<dd><b>Justin</b>: Guilty as charged. [<i>He picks T.V. up by his backpack and sets him in his other hand.</i>] You psyched for your birthday, birthday girl?

</dd>,<dd>[<i>T.V. screams, and the scene fades to black.</i>]

</dd>,<dd><b>Jake</b>: Uh-oh.
</dd>,<dd>[<i>T.V. turns over as though having a bad dream, still mumbling. Jake cautiously approaches.</i>]

</dd>,<dd><b>Jake</b>: Uh, close enough.
</dd>,<dd><b>T.V.</b>: Get out of my room!
</dd>,<dd>[<i>T.V. grabs the diary, hugs it to his chest and rolls over away from Jake.</i>]
</dd>,<dd><b>Jake</b>: T.V., what is that?
</dd>,<dd><b>T.V.</b>: [<i>Gets to his feet.</i>] Private property.
</dd>,<dd><b>Jake</b>: Gimme the book. [<i>He pulls it away from T.V. with some effort.</i>]
</dd>,<dd><b>T.V.</b>: Noooooo!
</dd>,<dd><b>Jake</b>: [<i>Opens the book.</i>] A diary, huh? Juicy. [<i>Flips through the pages.</i>] And now you've become dangerously obsessed with it, and have confused your reality with that of the diary keeper. [<i>Turns to T.V., who looks at the book over Jake's shoulder.</i>] You always were a little too susceptible to fantasy.
</dd>,<dd>[<i>Jake flips through pages until he reaches the end of the writing.</i>]
</dd>,<dd><b>Jake</b>: Ooh, ripped pages! Mystery.
</dd>,<dd><b>T.V.</b>: And look how the handwriting changes right before the rip! [<i>He points.</i>] The e's are all crabbed. That's weird, right?
</dd>,<dd><b>Jake</b>: That's super weird, son.
</dd>,<dd>[<i>T.V. steps away from Jake, and everything blends together around him.</i>]
</dd>,<dd><b>Jake</b>: She was obviously emotionally distraught. Maybe she was so stressed she broke out in hives!
</dd>,<dd>[<i>T.V. breaks out in hives. He looks down at himself, horrified.</i>]
</dd>,<dd><b>Jake</b>:  And they covered her whole body. So they rushed her to the hospital.
</dd>,<dd>[<i>Two candy nurses hurry past, carrying a gurney between them. T.V. throws himself on it and is carried off. Now in a hall of the <a href=""/wiki/Candy_Kingdom_Hospital"" title=""Candy Kingdom Hospital"">Candy Kingdom Hospital</a>, the nurses carry T.V. into an operating room.</i>]
</dd>,<dd><b>Jake</b>: She was thinking, ""oh man I'm so young,"" and how life is so unfair, and that this was the end.
</dd>,<dd>[<i>The door slams shut behind the nurses and the screen goes black. The following morning we see T.V., asleep, the sun shining on him from a window while a monitor beeps.</i>]
</dd>,<dd><b>Jake</b>: But it wasn't the end. She had pulled through. Except her hand had been replaced with a crab hand!
</dd>,<dd>[<i>T.V. pulls a crab hand out from under the covers and stares at it in shock.</i>]
</dd>,<dd><b>Jake</b>: Which negatively affected her handwriting.
</dd>,<dd><b>T.V.</b>: Yeah!
</dd>,<dd>[<i>T.V. sleeps next to a window now, which shows the sun rising and falling to denote the passage of time.</i>]
</dd>,<dd><b>T.V.</b>: And, and, while I recovered, I refused all visitors.
</dd>,<dd><b>Jake</b>: Wait... <i>you</i> refused?
</dd>,<dd><b>T.V.</b>: Especially Justin. [<i>Night falls, and a nurse turns on a lamp.</i>] How could he love a girl with a crab hand?
</dd>,<dd>[<i>T.V. tosses and turns in his sleep.</i>]
</dd>,<dd><b>T.V.</b>: I mean... that is definitely not normal.
</dd>,<dd>[<i>On a table next to the bed we see a series of flowers in vases, then the heart monitor.</i>]
</dd>,<dd><b>T.V.</b>: Justin sent me flowers every day for a week.
</dd>,<dd>[<i>At the end of the line of flowers there are two potted plants, then an empty vase.</i>]
</dd>,<dd><b>T.V.</b>: Then every other day.
</dd>,<dd>[<i>At the end of the table is a single flower in a vase.</i>]
</dd>,<dd><b>T.V.</b>: Then they stopped coming all together.
</dd>,<dd>[<i>A petal falls. Later, T.V. walks up the path to Love Tree Point. The crab hand is wrapped in a black garbage bag secured with tape.</i>]
</dd>,<dd><b>T.V.</b>: On my birthday I decided I was going to keep my promise to meet Justin, crab hand or no crab hand. But when I got to Love Tree Point, Justing was already there...
</dd>,<dd>[<i>T.V. gasps. At the top of Love Tree Point Taffi, Mochi and Justin sit together. Justin and Mochi kiss.</i>]
</dd>,<dd><b>T.V.</b>: ...Making out with my BFFs Taffi and Mochi!
</dd>,<dd>[<i>Back in the Candy Kingdom moat, T.V. stares dramatically into the distance, his eyes watery. Jake stands at the edge of the moat with the diary.</i>]
</dd>,<dd><b>Jake</b>: [<i>Shocked,</i>] He did not! [<i>Opens the diary.</i>] Well, that's one theory, anyway.
</dd>,<dd><b>T.V.</b>: Am I unlovable?
</dd>,<dd><b>Jake</b>: Hey, did you say Love Tree Point? That's where the kids used to go smoochin' back in the day. This diary must be pretty old.
</dd>,<dd>[<i>T.V. sniffles and wipes his nose with his arm. Jake comes closer, still reading the diary.</i>]
</dd>,<dd><b>Jake</b>: We should go check it out.
</dd>,<dd>[<i>Jake and T.V. climb to the top of Love Tree Point in the present day. The hill is mostly barren, the tree at its top only an old stump. Assorted garbage is on the ground.</i>]
</dd>,<dd><b>Jake</b>: Ugh, this place is a dump.
</dd>,<dd><b>T.V.</b>: [<i>Looking around,</i>] Why do they call this Love Tree Point?
</dd>,<dd><b>Jake</b>: Because of that tree over there.
</dd>,<dd>[<i>Jake points to a tree trunk that's taken the shape of a heart in its middle.</i>]
</dd>,<dd><b>Jake</b>: Yeah, it's pretty heavy-handed.
</dd>,<dd><b>T.V.</b>: [<i>Holds the diary to his chest.</i>] On page 42 it says Justin hid a present somewhere around here. Maybe it's in the tree.
</dd>,<dd><b>Jake</b>: Hey, good thinking!
</dd>,<dd>[<i>Jake stretches over to the hollow part of the tree. Inside is a box with a gold clasp.</i>]
</dd>,<dd><b>Jake</b>: Bingo!
</dd>,<dd>[<i>Jake's tail wags as he stretches back down to normal size, the box in his hands. Close up of the box; ""BP+JR 4EVA"" is carved into the lid. T.V. Opens the clasp and the lid pops up. He gasps. Inside are two figures with cat ears and tails. Music plays as the figures nod at each other, come together and begin to dance around the inside of the box. T.V. leans in close.</i>]
</dd>,<dd><b>T.V.</b>: It's so beautiful...
</dd>,<dd><b>Jake</b>: Yeah... B.P. would have love this.
</dd>,<dd>[<i>T.V. closes the box and walks away. Jakes eyes water, and he clutches the box to his chest.</i>]
</dd>,<dd><b>Jake</b>: Justin must have been too devastated to reclaim it. Maybe he thinks she'll come back for it one day. [<i>He twists to look out over the water.</i>]
</dd>,<dd><b>T.V.</b>: [<i>Sniffles.</i>] We've got to find her, Dad!
</dd>,<dd>[<i>T.V. falls to his knees and sobs. Jake turns back to his son and looks down at the box in his hands.</i>]
</dd>,<dd><b>Jake</b>: She never knew how much she meant to him. To all of us!
</dd>,<dd>[<i>Jake starts crying too. High above, Lady Rainicorn watches them for a moment, then flies away.</i>]
</dd>,<dd><b>Lady Rainicorn</b>: 어으, 놀고들 있네. (Ugh, playing around.)
</dd>,<dd>[<i>It's the next day.</i>]
</dd>,<dd><b>Jake</b>: Y'know, son, I bet I know where this music box is from.
</dd>,<dd>[<i>Jake and T.V. walk through the stalls of the <a href=""/wiki/Farmer%27s_Market"" title=""Farmer's Market"">Farmer's Market</a>. Jake carries the box, T.V. carries the diary.</i>]
</dd>,<dd><b>Jake</b>: Maybe they can give us a clue.
</dd>,<dd>[<i>At the music box stall Jake hands the box over to the salesman.</i>]
</dd>,<dd><b>Salesman</b>: Oh, yes. Yes, this is one of mine. From my ""dancing cat"" period. [<i>He opens the box.</i>]
</dd>,<dd><b>T.V.</b>: Do you remember who bought it?
</dd>,<dd><b>Salesman</b>: Oh, goodness. [<i>He holds the box up in front of him.</i>] It feels like a lifetime ago. I must have made hundreds of boxes since then, each marrying sound and motion to tell a unique story... The dance of the cosmos in miniature.
</dd>,<dd><b>Jake</b>: Okay...Well, we gotta go.
</dd>,<dd>[<i>Jake reaches out for the music box.</i>]
</dd>,<dd><b>Salesman</b>: [Suddenly,] A young man bought this!
</dd>,<dd><b>T.V.</b>: Justin! Was he handsome?
</dd>,<dd><b>Salesman</b>: Oh, very.
</dd>,<dd>[<i>Jake puts his arms down without taking the box.</i>]
</dd>,<dd><b>Jake</b>: Who was it meant for?
</dd>,<dd><b>Salesman</b>: A girl. Betsy.
</dd>,<dd><b>T.V.</b>: [Gasps.] B.P.!
</dd>,<dd><b>Salesman</b>: She ran away. Went wild, cut herself off from the world, hid away in a cave never to be seen again. [<i>He closes the music box.</i>]
</dd>,<dd><b>Jake</b>: Woah.
</dd>,<dd><b>T.V.</b>: But Dad, there are probably hundreds of caves in--
</dd>,<dd><b>Salesman</b>: It's the one at the fork in the road to Butterscotch Lake!
</dd>,<dd>[<i>Jake and T.V. run off. Jake stretches his arms back to take the box from the salesman.</i>]
</dd>,<dd><b>Salesman</b>: The box said she does weird stuff to bodies up there.
</dd>,<dd>[<i>T.V. Rides on Jake's back as he runs into the afforementioned cave.</i>]
</dd>,<dd><b>T.V.</b>: That's it!
</dd>,<dd>[<i>Inside Jake slows to a walk, panting. T.V.'s horn begins to glow in the darkness.</i>]
</dd>,<dd><b>T.V.</b>: Why do you think Betsy ran away, Dad?
</dd>,<dd><b>Jake</b>: Hard to say. [<i>He changes slowly back to his normal shape as he walks.</i>] Some people can't face their troubles. But T.V., hiding away won't solve anything.
</dd>,<dd><b>T.V.</b>: Look!
</dd>,<dd>[<i>T.V. slides off of Jake's back and runs ahead. Jake stops to catch his breath, hands on his knees.</i>]
</dd>,<dd><b>Jake</b>: Ah, teachable moment.
</dd>,<dd>[<i>At the end of the cave the top opens to the sky, creating a sheltered clearing where a small house stands. T.V. enters the house.</i>]
</dd>,<dd><b>T.V.</b>: Betsy?
</dd>,<dd>[<i>Light from T.V.'s horn moves across the bookshelf, which is covered in spider webs. T.V. walks further into the house.</i>]
</dd>,<dd><b>T.V.</b>: Betsy?
</dd>,<dd>[<i>T.V. glances down and sees a full-sized skeleton on the floor. He screams.</i>]
</dd>,<dd><b>T.V.</b>: Betsy... Oh my Glob. We're too late!
</dd>,<dd>[<i>Jake walks past T.V. and bends down by the skeleton. T.V. turns away and his eyes start to water.</i>]
</dd>,<dd><b>T.V.</b>: She was too good for this cruel world. [Sobs.]
</dd>,<dd>[<i>Jake straightens, righting a stand from which the skeleton hangs.</i>]
</dd>,<dd><b>Jake</b>: It's a model.
</dd>,<dd><b>T.V.</b>: Huh?
</dd>,<dd>[<i>T.V. turns to look at the skeleton.</i>]
</dd>,<dd><b>Jake</b>: It's plastic. [<i>Waving the skeleton's hand,</i>] ""Heeyyy.""
</dd>,<dd>[<i>At the bookshelf T.V. brushes dust off of the book spines to reveal their titles: ""GROSS ANATOMY"" and ""SURGERY"".</i>]
</dd>,<dd><b>Jake</b>: Hey, look at this!
</dd>,<dd>[<i>There's a makeshift bed in the corner of the room. A card on the pillow reads ""Justin"". Jake picks it up, and T.V. comes over to look.</i>]
</dd>,<dd><b>Jake</b>: Maybe we shouldn't read this...
</dd>,<dd><b>T.V.</b>: Yes, we should.
</dd>,<dd>[<i>In the past the real B.P. walks up to a tree, where she sits and writes in her diary.</i>]
</dd>,<dd><b>B.P. [<i>voiceover</i>]</b>: Dear Justin: I'm not sure you'll ever read this letter. Maybe I'm writing this more for myself anyway. You know when you're little, and the future feels really far away? You don't know what it looks like. You just hope you'll have stuff figured out by then. You'll know exactly how to act, and feel. You'll have conquered all your fears. And you'll never feel dumb or uncomfortable. You don't think about how you'll actually get there. The middle parts, between now and then? The middle parts suck. Which is why I split, I guess. Okay, so riding out your teen years in a cave is pretty dramatic, but do you know much reading you get done in a cave? I even figured out a cure for my crab hand!
</dd>,<dd>[<i>B.P. finishes writing and gets up. The diary, sealed in the plastic bag T.V. found it in, is lowered gently into chocolate water. B.P. watches as it rises to the surface and floats away.</i>]
</dd>,<dd><b>B.P. [<i>voiceover</i>]</b>: Oh Justin, I hope you're not too upset, and I hope you didn't spend too much money on that birthday present. It wouldn't have worked out between us anyway. You're kind of clingy. Sincerely, <a href=""/wiki/Nurse_Pound_Cake"" title=""Nurse Pound Cake"">Nurse Betsy Poundcake.</a>
</dd>,<dd>[<i>Back in the present, <a href=""/wiki/Dr._Ice_Cream"" title=""Dr. Ice Cream"">Dr. Ice Cream</a> is treating a patient in the Candy Kingdom Hospital's Emergency Room. The heartrate monitor beeps frantically.</i>]

</dd>,<dd>[<i>They walk away from the window together.</i>]

</dd>,<dd>[<i>Snow Golem gets some breakfast. He takes a box of <a href=""/wiki/Flakies"" title=""Flakies"">Flakies</a> and a bottle of milk, which actually contain a pear and acorns, respectively. He pours them into a bowl and eats.</i>]
</dd>,<dd>[<i>After eating, Snow Golem looks in his cupboard and finds that there is no more food. He draws an acorn and a pear on a piece of paper as a shopping list. He prepares to leave, putting on a small pouch and a garland of branches. He leaves his home, grabs a cart, and starts walking.</i>]
</dd>,<dd><b>Snow Golem</b>:  [<i>hums while walking through the forest</i>]

</dd>,<dd><b>Finn</b>:  Yeah, and if you were us, you'd kick your fat butt!

</dd>,<dd><b>Ice King</b>:  [<i>Laughs</i>] Not a scratch, boys! Not a scratch! It's my time to shine!

</dd>,<dd>[<i>Snow Golem touches a pear hanging from a tree. He squeezes another one, smells it, and picks it. He suddenly notices that it has a bruise.</i>]
</dd>,<dd><b>Snow Golem</b>:  [<i>Yelps</i>]
</dd>,<dd>[<i>Snow Golem places the pear on the tree branch. Suddenly, a pack of <a href=""/wiki/Fire_Wolves"" title=""Fire Wolves"">Fire Wolves</a> appears in front of him. They growl at him.</i>]
</dd>,<dd><b>Snow Golem</b>:  [<i>Shouting in fear</i>] Wuuuuh-wuuuh!
</dd>,<dd>[<i>Snow Golem slowly takes a pear from the ground and throws it at one of the wolves. The wolves pounce at Snow Golem and start attacking. Snow falls from the tree and a cloud of steam covers them. Snow Golem kicks away some wolves. The steam clears and Snow Golem is shown with a large branch stuck in his eye.</i>]
</dd>,<dd>[<i>After removing the branch, Snow Golem picks up his eye (a stone) from the ground. His cart, full of pears, is sideways and one of its wheels is off. Snow Golem picks up the wheel and finds a <a href=""/wiki/Fire_Wolf_Pup"" title=""Fire Wolf Pup"">Fire Wolf pup</a> biting the other end. Snow Golem shakes the wheel, throwing the pup off screen.</i>]
</dd>,<dd><b>Snow Golem</b>:  [<i>hums while he fixes his cart</i>]
</dd>,<dd>[<i>The pup approaches Snow Golem, emanating fire.</i>]
</dd>,<dd><b>Wolf of Fire</b>:  [<i>Barks playfully</i>]
</dd>,<dd><b>Snow Golem</b>:  [<i>Gets angry</i>]
</dd>,<dd>[<i>The pup keeps yipping and panting happily. Snow Golem touches it with a stick and the pup barks again and emanates fire.</i>]
</dd>,<dd>[<i>Snow Golem, humming, picks it up with the stick and leaves it on the branch of a nearby tree. Snow Golem walks away while still humming.</i>]
</dd>,<dd><b>Wolf of Fire</b>:  [<i>Emanates fire and barks while watching Snow Golem away</i>]
</dd>,<dd>[<i>The scene changes to Snow Golem trying not to be noticed while watching Finn and Jake trying to penetrate Ice King's ice armor.</i>]
</dd>,<dd><b>Ice King</b>:  Fools! Fools! You're wasting your ti-yime!
</dd>,<dd>[<i>Snow Golem comes home and rests in his snow chair</i>]
</dd>,<dd><b>Snow Golem</b>:  [<i>Sighs</i>]
</dd>,<dd>[<i>Snow Golem's cart explodes and spreads fire all around.</i>]
</dd>,<dd><b>Snow Golem</b>:  [<i>panics</i>] Wuh? Wuuuh-wuuuh! Wuuuh! Wuuuuh! [<i>Manages to put out the fire on his body.</i>] [<i>Calms down and notices that the pup caused the fire.</i>]

</dd>,<dd><b>Snow Golem</b>:  Ehh ... [<i>Picks up the pup with a piece of the cart, opens the door and throws him out of his house.</i>] [<i>He shuts the door and opens it again when he hears the pup moaning and shivering from cold.

</dd>,<dd>[<i>Snow Golem scares away the vultures by screaming and waving his hands. He sees the Fire Kingdom and then the sun setting. He has no choice but to invite the pup into his home. The Wolf comes running in and barking.</i>]
</dd>,<dd>[<i>Snow Golem enters the house and notices that the pup is not in the room. He enters the kitchen and sees various things on fire.</i>]
</dd>,<dd><b>Snow Golem</b>:  Wuh! Wuuuh! [<i>Puts out the flames with his hands and removes pup from the kitchen with a branch so that it cannot burn anything.</i>]
</dd>,<dd>[<i>Snow Golem sets down the pup, who barks, does a flip, and then sits. Snow Golem puts a rock on his tail to keep it in place. The pup tries to leave but to no avail.</i>]
</dd>,<dd>[<i>Snow Golem offers the pup a pear, trying to feed him. He motions to eat.</i>]
</dd>,<dd>[<i>The pup looks at Snow Golem, then bites the pear and swallows. Snow Golem is happy, but the pup coughs out the pear and shudders in disgust. He then makes a sucking motion with his lips.</i>]
</dd>,<dd><b>Snow Golem</b>:  Hmmm.
</dd>,<dd>[<i>The scene changes to Snow Golem in a farm feeding the pup with the milk of a cow, who is screaming in agony as the pup burns her udder. Snow Golem is happy.</i>]
</dd>,<dd>[<i>The scene returns to the Snow Golem's home, where he is trying to entertain the pup with his fingers. These have faces and sing with Snow Golem. The pup rejoices, barks and then licks one of Snow Golem's fingers, melting and causing Snow Golem pain.</i>]
</dd>,<dd><b>Snow Golem</b>:  Wuuuh! Wuuh! [<i>Blows what's left of his finger and tries to ease the pain</i>] Ah! Ahh ... Geesh ... [<i>The pup is sad</i>] ... [<i>mutters reassuringly</i>] Bo, bo, bop [<i>Fixes his finger (again with face) with a snowball and tries to entertain the pup again.</i>]
</dd>,<dd>[<i>Snow Golem shakes his hand, but his top-heavy arm falls off onto a plank. Then an icicle falls from the ceiling onto the plank, launching the hand with the face at Snow Golem's head, replacing it.</i>]
</dd>,<dd><b>Snow Golem</b>:  Huh? Wang nyangah yuh?!
</dd>,<dd>[<i>The pup is happy again. Snow Golem laughs.</i>]
</dd>,<dd>[<i>The scene changes. Snow Golem attempts to lull the pup to sleep, rocking it in a chair and humming a lullaby. The pup snores. Snow Golem sets it down and removes it from the chair with a stick.</i>]
</dd>,<dd>[<i>Suddenly, a howl from the Fire Wolf pack is heard. The pup joins them in howling while sleeping. Snow Golem thinks and sighs.</i>]
</dd>,<dd>[<i>Meanwhile, Finn, Jake and the Ice King are sleeping on the battlefield.</i>]
</dd>,<dd><b>Ice King</b>:  [<i>Sleeping</i>] Fools, fools, fools...
</dd>,<dd>[<i>Finn hits Ice King's armor with a stick in his sleep.</i>]
</dd>,<dd><b>Ice King</b>:  [<i>snore</i>] In-ice-able vince armor...
</dd>,<dd>[<i>The next morning, Alarm Clock Bird reappears and the pup launches a fireball at it. The bird, burned, coughs and flies away. Snow Golem wakes up and leaves home to take the pup to his family.</i>]

</dd>,<dd><b>Finn</b>:  Got you now!
</dd>,<dd><b>Jake</b>:  Yeah!
</dd>,<dd><b>Ice King</b>:  Aah! You can have the sandwiches back! I'm sorry! Help!
</dd>,<dd>[<i>Snow Golem makes its way to the mountain where the wolf pack lives. He tries to climb the mountain as he melts. He realizes that the pup is below and gasps. He also notices that his chair was burned because of the pup and throws it to the foot of the mountain.</i>]
</dd>,<dd>[<i>Snow Golem goes down the mountain to retrieve the pup. They look at each other. Then Snow Golem looks at his melting hand, noting the risk he has to take.</i>]
</dd>,<dd>[<i>Snow Golem manages to recover the pup. As he melts, they walk along the top of the mountain to where the herd are sleeping. They awaken and start growling aggressively.</i>]
</dd>,<dd>[<i>Snow Golem returns the pup to his family after the pup licks him. One wolf growls at Snow Golem and barks furiously. Snow Golem backs away.</i>]
</dd>,<dd><b>Snow Golem</b>:  Bye-bye.

</dd>,<dd><b>Ice King</b>:  Boy, those sandwiches look really cool! [<i>Finn continues eating</i>] It looks like it'd be really awesome to try a bite of one of those [<i>Jake also claims and continues to eat</i>] ... right on, right on.
</dd>,<dd>[<i>Snow Golem gives a little sigh and suddenly, the Fire Wolf pack appears behind some bushes. Snow Golem retracts in fear and the pup runs to him, pounces, melting Snow Golem, who laughs.</i>]
</dd>,<dd><b>Snow Golem</b>:  You ... the ... real good. Nice... home.
</dd>,<dd>[<i>The pup continues licking Snow Golem, melting him and reducing him to a puddle. Snow Golem continues laughing as Finn and Jake observe.</i>]
</dd>,<dd><b>Finn</b>:  Jake, do you think that puddle needs our help?
</dd>,<dd><b>Jake</b>:  Nah, it's a Snow Golem, man. I think he's laughing.
</dd>,<dd>[<i>Snow Golem and the Wolf are playing.</i>]
</dd>,<dd><b>Finn</b>:  I thought Snow Golems and Fire Wolves hated each other.
</dd>,<dd><b>Jake</b>:  Oh, yeah, big time.
</dd>,<dd><b>Finn</b>:  But they learned to get along.
</dd>,<dd><b>Jake</b>:  Yup.
</dd>,<dd><b>Ice King</b>:  You know ... maybe we could all learn a thing or two from those sandwiches.
</dd>,<dd>[<i>Finn watches Snow Golem and the pup continue playing.</i>]
</dd>,<dd>[<i>Finn kisses Ice King's cheek</i>]

</dd>,<dd><b>Finn</b>: Um... not really. I've never even met any other humans. If I think about it too much, I get all soul-searchy and weeeeiiirrrd...
</dd>,<dd><b>Princess Bubblegum</b>: [<i>Embarrassed</i>] Ohhh, boy... I've made things awkward. Well, let's forget about that. I brought you guys here because I need you to rip out all these stumps!
</dd>,<dd><b>Finn</b>: [<i>Half-heartedly, in a daze</i>] Okay... I guess so...
</dd>,<dd><b>Jake</b>: Yeah, man, it'll be fun! [<i>Shrinks and gets in Finn's hand</i>] Toss the Jake-sploder! [<i>Finn tosses Jake towards a stump</i>] Nyeeeeh, boom!

</dd>,<dd><b>Finn</b>: [<i>Running over</i>] Huh? [<i>Moving bush</i>] It's a hatch.
</dd>,<dd><b>Jake</b>: A hatch? [<i>He jumps on it and opens the lid.</i>] We should check it out, ya think?! [<i>He jumps down.</i>] [<i>Excitedly</i>] Waaah!
</dd>,<dd><b>Finn</b>: Heh-heh. [<i>Finn jumps down, and the lid closes.

He opens his eyes in surprise, looks around, and turns to see <a href=""/wiki/Jake"" title=""Jake"">Jake</a> holding a piece of paper and smiling.</i>]
</dd>,<dd><b>Jake</b>: [<i>Flips the paper upward to reveal some writing</i>] ""I'm not talking today"" [<i>it states.</i>] [<i>He gives the paper a little shake to emphasize the intent.</i>]
</dd>,<dd><b>Finn</b>: [<i>Smiles and reaches behind his pillow to grab a paper of his own, he holds it up</i>] ""Me too"" [<i>it states.</i>]
</dd>,<dd><b>Jake</b>: [<i>Begins writing on a new paper. He flips it over</i>] ""When did you make your sign?""
</dd>,<dd><b>Finn</b>: [<i>Writes back</i>] ""Last night when I saw you writing yours"".
</dd>,<dd><b>Jake</b>: [<i>Replies with</i>] ""You fancy a wager, buddy?""
</dd>,<dd><b>Finn</b>: [<i>Accepts</i>] ""Bringeth it on, sir!""
</dd>,<dd><b>Jake</b>: [<i>Hops out of his bed and onto Finn's with papers in hand.</i>]
</dd>,<dd><b>Jake</b>: [<i>Flips his newly written message,</i>] ""So, what are the stakes?"" [<i>He waits for Finn's reply.</i>]
</dd>,<dd><b>Finn</b>: ""Whoever talks first will be really disappointed""
</dd>,<dd><b>Jake</b>: ""Can we use signs?""
</dd>,<dd><b>Finn</b>: ""Yes, but only the ones we write in the next thirty seconds""
</dd>,<dd>[<i>They both begin to write on the rest of their papers.</i>]
</dd>,<dd>[<i>In the kitchen breakfast was made, a pot of coffee is on a warmer and Jake and Finn sit with their plates in front of them. Finn gives a thumbs up.</i>]
</dd>,<dd><b>Jake</b>: [<i>Pushes his plate away to shuffle through his signs, he finds the one he wants and flips it over,</i>] ""What's your favorite part?"" [<i>it states,</i>] [<i>he flips another sign</i>] ""... of the breakfast, I mean"".
</dd>,<dd><b>Finn</b>: [<i>Pushes his plate away and looks at his signs, but before he can choose one Jake flips over another sign.</i>]
</dd>,<dd><b>Jake</b>: ""the juice?"", ""the toast?"", ""the jam?"". [<i>By this point Finn gives an annoyed stare and shuffles through his signs some more, looking for a response. Jake interrupts him with another sign</i>] ""the Tea?""
</dd>,<dd><b>Finn</b>: [<i>Finally picks a sign only to have it state</i>] ""Hi, Jake""
</dd>,<dd><b>Jake</b>: ""You didn't write enough signs, did you dummy?""
</dd>,<dd><b>Finn</b>: [<i>Still appearing annoyed he shuffles through his signs again, only getting the following</i>] ""Thanks, Jake"", ""That's funny, Jake"", ""Nice catch, Jake"", ""Go get'm Jake!"" [<i>and finally,</i>] ""You the man, Jake!"" [<i>complete with thumbs up and smiley face.</i>] [<i>He instead flips to another sign that is revealed to be</i>] ""I love you, Jake"". [<i>Jake reacts to this by squishing his cheeks and pursing his lips with affection.</i>]
</dd>,<dd>[<i>They both turn to a sound of walking, it is BMO.</i>]
</dd>,<dd><b><a href=""/wiki/BMO"" title=""BMO"">BMO</a></b>: Finn, Jake, I invited some <a href=""/wiki/Bikini_Babes"" title=""Bikini Babes"">Bikini Babes</a> over to dance to this song! [<i>It plays ""<a href=""/wiki/No_Wonder_I"" title=""No Wonder I"">No Wonder I</a>"", a slow song, and begins to dance to it.</i>] It's my favorite song, it makes me so happy! [<i>Instead of saying anything they both smile at BMO and wave their arms. BMO is perplexed,</i>] Um, why are you not talking?
</dd>,<dd>[<i>Finn and Jake ruffle through their signs for a response. Jake turns over a sign</i>] ""the juice?"", [<i>followed by Finn with</i>] ""Me too"".
</dd>,<dd><b>BMO</b>: What?
</dd>,<dd><b>Finn</b>: [<i>Pokes Jake on the shoulder, he then points to his mouth and then at BMO, who is still confused. Finn then makes kissy lips and points in BMO's direction again.</i>]
</dd>,<dd><b>Jake</b>: [<i>Becomes agitated and crossing his arms and baring his teeth, he rapidly shakes his head. He then bops Finn on the head and covers his mouth as well as his own.</i>] [<i>They both look back to BMO.</i>]
</dd>,<dd><b>BMO</b>: [<i>In a panic</i>] Why are you not talking! What happened to Finn and Jake?! You have taken over their bodies! [<i>Screaming it runs to a hole in the wall and dives in.</i>] [<i>Finn lifts up a sign</i>] ""Oh dang"". [<i>Inside the wall BMO whimpers and a single digital tear runs down its faceplate.</i>]
</dd>,<dd>[<i>Outside of the wall Finn and Jake listen for BMO. Finn puts a cup to the wall while Jake stretches his ear to another hole. He hears BMO's whimpering; Finn hears it too and taps the wood.</i>]
</dd>,<dd>[<i>Inside BMO turns to the direction of the noise and covers its speakers.</i>] [<i>Back outside Finn stopped tapping the wall while Jake knocks on it. This causes BMO to panic more.</i>]
</dd>,<dd><b>BMO</b>: Oh oh, what should I do?! [<i>It turns on its favorite song, grabs its knees and rocks from side to side.</i>]
</dd>,<dd>[<i>Outside of the Tree Fort a single Bikini Babe with green skin and black hair comes walking over a hill, she arrives at the fort and knocks on the door.</i>]
</dd>,<dd><b>Bikini Babe (green skin;black hair)</b>: BMO? [<i>Puts her hands on her hips and looks at her wrist watch.</i>]
</dd>,<dd>[<i>Back inside.</i>]
</dd>,<dd><b>Jake</b>: [<i>Dashes to the kitchen table to pick up a sign</i>] ""I'm going in there"". [<i>He then looks through a box to find a headlamp, he quickly goes back to his signs and with a look of suspicion to Finn, he picks one up and flips it over</i>] ""Don't touch my signs"".
</dd>,<dd><b>Finn</b>: ""Of course not, man"". [<i>Jake puts a skull on his signs and gives Finn one final stare before heading to the wall.</i>]
</dd>,<dd>[<i>When he gets to the wall he realizes he as well as the headlamp can't fit, so he shrinks down and fits through the hole, only to attempt to pull in the headlamp afterwards, when it doesn't fit he leaves it behind.</i>]
</dd>,<dd>[<i>Now inside the wall he passes a spider's web and flicks it. This wakes up a spider who angrily points at him and shakes its fist. Jake merely gives a thumbs up and blows the spider a kiss. The spider calms down and waves by to Jake as he continues on.</i>]
</dd>,<dd>[<i>Jake arrives at the sleeping area of six mice who all have their own bed starting from largest to smallest. An alarm above the beds rings for morning and the mice awake, and from smallest to largest they all exit the beds and head to a running wheel, the largest mouse is turning a crank for the wheel to move as the small ones play on it. Jake then leaves.</i>]
</dd>,<dd>[<i>He comes to a bag of dice and a branch that grew to look like stairs. At the bottom of the stairs is a small paper with the words</i>] ""Private"" [<i>written on it. Jake walks up the stairs and sees a small man typing away on a type writer. The man finishes typing on the paper to remove it from the machine and places it on other stacks of papers. Jake grabs the just laid paper, reads it and then stretches his arm out back to the kitchen. There it is seen that Finn has disobeyed Jake and looked through his signs as well as mixing them up with is own. When Jake's arm arrives with the tiny paper, Finn is surprised and drops the ones he had. He grabs the small paper and it reads</i>] ""Life in the wall is a drag, man"". [<i>Finn sets the paper on the table and grabs one from Jake's pile and hands it to him.</i>]
</dd>,<dd>[<i>Back inside the wall Jake gets the message</i>] ""I hear you, man"". [<i>He folds this up and places it in a pocket he made from stretching. Leaving the area he ends up at a cat shaped sarcophagus. From the outside ""No Wonder I"" can be heard. Jake pulls the sarcophagus open to see BMO, the song stops and it yells at Jake.</i>]
</dd>,<dd><b>BMO</b>: [<i>Screams</i>] Go away!! Where is the real Jake?! You are doubleganger<sup id=""cite_ref-0"" class=""reference""><a href=""#cite_note-0"">[1]</a></sup> you- body taker! [<i>It hits Jake who then runs away. BMO grunts in frustration but turns the song back and goes back to holding its knees and rocking side to side.</i>]
</dd>,<dd>[<i>Outside the Tree Fort four more Bikini Babes have arrived, one with green skin and brown hair in pigtails knocks on the door.</i>]
</dd>,<dd><b>Bikini Babe (green skin;brown hair)</b>: BMO, BMO are you home? BMO, we're here to dance with you! [<i>Another bikini babe arrives, she is blue skin with blonde hair.</i>] [<i>When they get no response they listen in with the hands cupped.</i>]
</dd>,<dd><b>Jake</b>: [<i>Coming out of the hole and walking up to Finn, he frowns when he sees his signs have been touched.</i>] [<i>When Jake taps him on the shoulder Finn creates an elaborate display of signs.</i>]
</dd>,<dd><b>Finn</b>: ""Jake, what are you implying? That I would touch your signs after being expressly forbidden to do so?"". [<i>He shuffles them back and Jake is still frowning.</i>]
</dd>,<dd><b>Jake</b>: [<i>Picks up two signs</i>] ""Oh dang, the toast?"", [<i>he tosses them and walks off.</i>]
</dd>,<dd><b>Finn</b>: [<i>Follows him and shows him a sign that states</i>] ""Jake rules!"", [<i>this gets a smile.</i>] [<i>Finn then shows another sign</i>] ""What're we gonna do..."" [<i>flips</i>] ""about BMO?""
</dd>,<dd><b>Jake</b>: [<i>Taps his forehead and expresses that he has an idea.</i>]
</dd>,<dd><b>Finn</b>: [<i>Flips a sign</i>] ""What?""
</dd>,<dd><b>Jake</b>: [<i>Points to his nose.</i>]
</dd>,<dd><b>Finn</b>: [<i>Flips a sign with</i>] ???
</dd>,<dd>[<i>Jake goes to a table with a TV and piles games and other electronic equipment. He grabs a stack and places them by the hole BMO dived through, Finn grabs a stack himself. Jake then gets an electric fan and places it in front of the games, Finn turns on the fan and a scent trail wafts through the hole. BMO pops its head out and sniffs, as it is about to grab one of the games it looks up to see Finn and Jake hiding in the kitchen behind tables, a bottle has been knocked over by Finn.</i>]
</dd>,<dd>[<i>They both walk out from their hiding place holding up signs</i>] ""It's OK!"". [<i>BMO gives a small scream, trips and runs back to the hole in the wall. When Finn and Jake get there they can hear BMO playing ""No Wonder I"" again.</i>]
</dd>,<dd>[<i>Outside the Tree Fort more Bikini Babes have arrived and wonder what is happening.</i>] ""I don't know, I don't have nothing else to do"" [<i>says one,</i>] ""Yeah"" [<i>replies another.</i>] [<i>One of them looks upwards towards the roof, she has light green skin with blond hair in a bandana, she flaps her hands and flies upward. This results in others following her lead, they all land on the roof.</i>]
</dd>,<dd>[<i>While back inside Finn and Jake are at a table and have spread all their signs on it. They have been ripping pieces to compile a message for BMO. As Jake places the last piece they shake hands.</i>]
</dd>,<dd>[<i>The message</i>] ""BMO we love you we're Finn and Jake for real! We're not talking today because we're playing a game! We love you!""
</dd>,<dd><b>Jake</b>: [<i>Shifts his hand to become bigger and pounds on the wall.</i>]
</dd>,<dd><b>BMO</b>: No way fake boys! I am never coming out! [<i>Finn and Jake shrug.</i>]
</dd>,<dd>[<i>Jake runs to a wall with an axe and grabs it, he begins to chop at the wall. Finn has also gotten an axe to join him. All of their chopping causes the wall to split and the roof to collapse. The Bikini Babes land on the floor. They sit confused for a bit until BMO's voice is heard.</i>]
</dd>,<dd><b>BMO</b>: Bikini Babes! They're not Finn and Jake! Get them! [<i>The Bikini Babes spring into action and begin hurling objects at Finn and Jake who take cover behind the overturned table.</i>]
</dd>,<dd>[<i>While behind the table Finn holds up a sign</i>] ""Let's split up"", [<i>followed by Jake with</i>] ""Okay"". [<i>As they split up two groups of Babes go after them. A Bikini Babe with green skin;orange hair grabs Finn in a chokehold while another with light blue skin;black hair grabs Jake by the leg. Finn manages to flip the Babe that was chocking him and runs. Jake is now captured by two Babes, one with dark blue skin;curly black hair- they tug at his stretched arms.</i>]
</dd>,<dd>[<i>Meanwhile BMO sits on the shoulders of a light blue;ponytail purple haired Babe and pumping its fist. As the fight continues the pigtailed Babe chases Finn, hitting him with a plank of wood. Finn is in pain but simply flips up the signs</i>] ""OUCH"", ""OW"", ""HEY"".
</dd>,<dd>[<i>The fight continues but some of the Babes have stopped to dance a bit, and Jake is being treated like a volleyball, being palmed by two Babes; the dark blue and now a light blue;brown hair. Back to Finn who is trying to keep three Babes at bay with a chair.</i>]
</dd>,<dd>[<i>The scene shifts to the pigtail Babe who is sitting on the stove shaking maracas with a sign in her mouth</i>] ""the jam?"".
</dd>,<dd>[<i>Finn has broken free of the group, tosses the chair and runs. Jake on the other hand is surrounded by three Babes with one sitting on him punching him in the head. He tosses her off and begins to intimidate them with Kung-fu hand movements, they all stare and begin to back away. This doesn't deter two of the Babes as they dive for Finn and Jake and hold them down.</i>] [<i>Finn is seen dragging himself as a light blue;short purple haired Babe hangs on.</i>] [<i>The green skin;black haired Babe pulls Jake's arm above his head and pinches him all over when she pinches his jowls Jake yells out loud,</i>]
</dd>,<dd><b>Jake</b>: Ow, ow! Okay fine! Uncle uncle, please stop pinching me Bikini Babe!.
</dd>,<dd><b>Finn</b>: [<i>Finn pumps his fist in triumph</i>] Oh, I win! [<i>sighs</i>] you're so disappointed. [<i>Laughs.</i>]
</dd>,<dd><b>BMO</b>: Finn? Jake? For real?
</dd>,<dd><b>Finn</b>: We were just playing a game, BMO. It all started this morning when Jake made a sign that said-
</dd>,<dd><b>BMO</b>: Oh, I don't care. Let's just-a party!
</dd>,<dd>[<i>They all dance around when suddenly a brown object crashes through the roof, it is the Party God.</i>]

</dd>,<dd><b>Neptr</b>: BMO, when is something going to happen?
</dd>,<dd><b>BMO</b>: Shh. Just watch. It happens once a month—I promise.
</dd>,<dd><b>Jake</b>: [<i>yawns</i>]
</dd>,<dd>[<i>His tail twitches.</i>]
</dd>,<dd><b>BMO</b>: [<i>pointing</i>] This is it!
</dd>,<dd>[<i>Jake's tail starts stretching.</i>]
</dd>,<dd><b>Neptr</b>: Oooooh.
</dd>,<dd>[<i>BMO beckons Neptr, and they follow the tail downstairs. The tail stretches over to the couch, where it takes a hat out from between the cushions and puts it on. It then stretches over to the kitchen table and prepares a <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/bindle"" class=""extiw"" title=""wikipedia:bindle"">bindle</a> of various fruits and nuts. The tail stretches to the front door, opens it, and leaves the fort.</i>]
</dd>,<dd><b>Neptr</b>: But where does it go?
</dd>,<dd><b>BMO</b>: That's none of our business.
</dd>,<dd>[<i>The tail continues stretching over hills, under a horse, into a forest, and past the entrance of a circus.</i>]
</dd>,<dd><b>Bug</b>: Tickets! Get your tickets here! See the world's greatest tiny circus! Witness the amazing wood-eating termite! The mighty strong-ant!
</dd>,<dd>[<i>At the back of the circus, the <a href=""/wiki/Ringmaster"" title=""Ringmaster"">ringmaster</a> confronts Jake's tail.</i>]
</dd>,<dd><b>Ringmaster</b>: You're late, Blue Nose! Get into makeup!
</dd>,<dd>[<i>Jake's tail stretches into his trailer. Meanwhile, inside the big top, a blindfolded praying mantis throws a sharp projectile at a target, against which leans a female bug. The projectile hits the target, and the audience oohs and aahs. The mantis throws another one and narrowly misses the bug, which elicits gasps and applause from the audience.</i>]
</dd>,<dd>[<i>Inside Blue Nose's trailer, Jake's tail puts on makeup, comprising a blue nose and a sad mouth.</i>]
</dd>,<dd>[<i>Back in the tent, the band gives a drum roll and the audience gasps. The <a href=""/wiki/Snail"" title=""Snail"">Snail</a>, wearing a swim cap, does a flip off the top of a staircase into a bucket of water.</i>]
</dd>,<dd><b>Audience</b>: [<i>cheers and applauds</i>]
</dd>,<dd>[<i>The Snail exits, and a record starts playing some melancholy music. Blue Nose enters the arena pushing a cart of oranges. He picks up an orange and sets it back down, but it rolls off and lands on the ground. Blue Nose shakes his head and rolls the orange away. He then notices a bee puppet sleeping in the pile of oranges. Blue Nose wakes it up and helps it down. It bows, and Blue Nose does the same. It starts dancing, and Blue Nose joins in. After bowing to each other again, the puppet suddenly places its hands over its heart and falls down. A spotlight shines on the puppet, and it is hoisted up to the ceiling. Blue Nose dances for a bit but ends up staring at the ground.</i>]
</dd>,<dd><b>Audience member</b>: [<i>laughs mockingly</i>]
</dd>,<dd><b>Audience</b>: [<i>boos and hisses</i>]
</dd>,<dd><b>Male audience member</b>: You stink!
</dd>,<dd><b>Young girl in audience</b>: [<i>cries</i>]
</dd>,<dd>[<i>The audience throws various trash and food at Blue Nose, who leaves the arena.</i>]
</dd>,<dd><b>Ringmaster</b>: [<i>to Blue Nose</i>] Too much artsy, not enough fartsy. We talked about this, clown! [<i>to audience</i>] Heh-heh, wasn't that something? Ladies and gentlemen, boys and girls, you're perfectly safe. But at this time, I'd like to ask anyone with a medical condition to please leave the premises at once. What you're about to witness with your own eyes may shock and astound you to your very core.
</dd>,<dd>[<i>An audience member takes a sip of <a href=""/wiki/Bug_milk"" title=""Bug milk"">bug milk</a>.</i>]
</dd>,<dd><b>Ringmaster</b>: Tonight, I give you the wildest, most dangerous beast anywhere in captivity! The horrible, the stupendous... [<i>cracks whip</i>] <a href=""/wiki/Goralina"" title=""Goralina"">Goralina</a>!
</dd>,<dd>[<i>The audience gasps as a shackled chipmunk is brought to the center of the arena. Blue Nose turns around to watch. The ringmaster cracks his whip, and a member of the audience throws its bug milk at Goralina, giving her a black eye. She growls, and the ringmaster continues cracking his whip. Goralina roars and breaks her handcuffs, drags the bugs holding her restraints on their backs, and slaps two more bugs with her tail.</i>]
</dd>,<dd><b>Ringmaster</b>: [<i>cracking whip</i>] [<i>laughs</i>] Attagirl!
</dd>,<dd>[<i>Goralina picks up the ringmaster and throws him at the audience. She then grabs a handful of screaming audience members and stuffs them into her mouth.</i>]
</dd>,<dd><b>Dad bug</b>: [<i>to son</i>] Don't worry, Junior. It's all part of the act.
</dd>,<dd>[<i>The audience continues screaming as Blue Nose wheels a flight of stairs up to Goralina and climbs them. He nods to the band, which starts playing some slow music. Blue Nose starts wiggling back and forth like a kind of inverse snake charmer. Goralina gets hypnotized and starts swaying back and forth, along with the audience. The blindfolded mantis runs in and throws a tranquilizing projectile into her tail. Goralina continues swaying for a bit, but she soon closes her eyes, falls with a thud, and spits out the audience members. Blue Nose rests on the staircase as the scene transitions with an <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wipe_(transition)"" class=""extiw"" title=""wikipedia:Wipe (transition)"">iris wipe</a>.</i>]
</dd>,<dd>[<i>The scene changes to the ringmaster trying to fit a 5¢ coin into a safe. Blue Nose knocks on the door.</i>]
</dd>,<dd><b>Ringmaster</b>: Blue Nose! Boy, am I glad to see you. Come in, come in! Sit down. You did good out there tonight with the belly-dancing routine. Real good. Aw, don't give me that look. I know we said we were going to let the chipmunk go at the end of last season, but Goralina is our big draw. You understand that.
</dd>,<dd>[<i>Blue Nose remains motionless.</i>]
</dd>,<dd><b>Ringmaster</b>: We're barely breaking even here—what do you want from me?! Look, there's another show in an hour. You come up with an act that can rival Goralina, then we can talk. But look what she got us last night: three whole pennies. Think you can make me this kind of cash? You do that, I won't need the chipmunk anymore. I'll let her go, just like I promised. But you're gonna have to lose the fancy-schmancy stuff and [<i>pounds table</i>] give the people what they want! Get it?!
</dd>,<dd>[<i>The door creaks shut offscreen. Blue Nose visits Goralina in her cage and removes a sign saying ""DO NOT FEED THE MONSTER."" He takes off his hat and offers the fruits and nuts inside to the chipmunk, who eats them hungrily. On his way back to the tent, he overturns the cart of oranges and bee puppet. Outside the tent, he opens a chest marked ""BLUE NOSE"" and glances at the whoopee cushion and spritzer inside.</i>]
</dd>,<dd>[<i>The scene changes to inside the tent, where the band is playing some lively music. Blue Nose enters the arena, and the band stops playing. Blue Nose cranks the record player, and the same melancholy music starts playing. The ringmaster slaps himself in disappointment. Blue Nose then sits on a chair with a cushion, triggering the whoopee cushion underneath it.</i>]
</dd>,<dd><b>Audience</b>: [<i>laughs</i>]
</dd>,<dd><b>Ringmaster</b>: [<i>pleased</i>] The old Blue Nose magic.
</dd>,<dd>[<i>He tosses the whoopee cushion aside and sits back down, but the chair suddenly breaks apart.</i>]
</dd>,<dd><b>Audience</b>: [<i>laughs</i>]
</dd>,<dd>[<i>Blue Nose goes over to a table, picks up a cup, and taps the spritzer, which sprays him in the face. He shudders and taps the spritzer again. He picks it up and sits on it, causing it to spray everywhere.</i>]
</dd>,<dd><b>Audience</b>: [<i>laughs</i>]
</dd>,<dd><b>Dad bug</b>: [<i>to son</i>] Aren't you glad we came back for the second show?
</dd>,<dd>[<i>Blue Nose then goes back to the record player and starts scratching it and dancing. He stops, stares at it, and goes offscreen. He returns with a stick, with which he smashes the player and shatters the record.</i>]
</dd>,<dd><b>Audience</b>: [<i>laughs, cheers, and applauds</i>] [<i>throws pennies into the arena</i>]
</dd>,<dd>[<i>Blue Nose shakes his head disapprovingly, then leaves the arena.</i>]
</dd>,<dd><b>Ringmaster</b>: Oho! You were great, kid! That's what I'm talking about. With you <i>and</i> the chipmunk in the show, we're gonna have a real one-two punch!
</dd>,<dd>[<i>Blue Nose shakes with fury and gets up in the ringmaster's face.</i>]
</dd>,<dd><b>Ringmaster</b>: Hey... I know what I said, but I want to see how many boxcars this gravy train has on it.
</dd>,<dd>[<i>Goralina is brought in.</i>]
</dd>,<dd><b>Ringmaster</b>: Look at her. It's like looking at a big, sad dollar sign.
</dd>,<dd>[<i>Blue Nose shakes angrily and picks up the ringmaster's whip.</i>]
</dd>,<dd><b>Ringmaster</b>: [<i>gasps</i>]
</dd>,<dd>[<i>Blue Nose cracks it at the ringmaster.</i>]
</dd>,<dd><b>Ringmaster</b>: Yipe!
</dd>,<dd><b>Audience</b>: [<i>laughs, cheers, applauds</i>]
</dd>,<dd>[<i>Blue Nose chases the ringmaster around the arena with the whip, cracking it intermittently.</i>]
</dd>,<dd><b>Ringmaster</b>: Whoa-ho!
</dd>,<dd><b>Strongman</b>: [<i>laughs</i>] [<i>sees Blues Nose coming for him</i>] Oh!
</dd>,<dd>[<i>Blue Nose wraps around the strongman, turns him upside down, and repeatedly hits his head on the ground.</i>]
</dd>,<dd><b>Audience</b>: [<i>laughs</i>]
</dd>,<dd>[<i>Blue Nose motions for Goralina to join him. The chipmunk nods, breaks its shackles, and runs out of the tent with Blue Nose. The ringmaster and strongman follow them outside, where the strongman grabs Blue Nose's body and starts yanking him back.</i>]
</dd>,<dd><b>Ringmaster</b>: That's right. Lift with your legs first, then put your back into it.
</dd>,<dd>[<i>They reach Blue Nose's head.</i>]
</dd>,<dd><b>Ringmaster</b>: There he is. Gotcha! Thought you could skip out, eh? and start your own circus!
</dd>,<dd><b>Strongman</b>: Yeah, you! You and your corny clown hat! [<i>takes off Blue Nose's hat and rubs it in his face, turning the frown upside down</i>]
</dd>,<dd><b>Other performer</b>: Hey, he's smiling! [<i>slaps Blue Nose</i>]
</dd>,<dd><b>Strongman</b>: [<i>slaps him</i>] What's so funny?
</dd>,<dd><b>Other performer</b>: You rat! [<i>slaps him</i>]
</dd>,<dd><b>Strongman</b>: [<i>slaps him</i>] You creep! What's the big joke?
</dd>,<dd>[<i>Suddenly, dawn breaks, and a ray of sunlight hits Blue Nose. He twitches, then starts moving backwards into the tent, through the arena, and back through the audience.</i>]
</dd>,<dd><b>Audience</b>: [<i>gasps and murmurs</i>]
</dd>,<dd>[<i>Blue Nose passes his chest of supplies, Goralina's cage, the ringmaster's trailer, the circus arena again, his trailer, and the circus entrance. On his way back, he spots Goralina hugging a squirrel. He leaves the forest, goes back under the horse, over a hill, into the Tree Fort, past the kitchen table and couch, and up the stairs. When the tail reaches Jake, he flips and wakes up. He reaches behind him and finds Blue Nose's tiny hat, which he tosses aside. He reaches behind him again and gets Blue Nose's makeup on his hand, which he sniffs and licks. Finn, watching this, sets down his drink.</i>]
</dd>,<dd><b>BMO</b>: [<i>laughs</i>]
</dd>,<dd><b>Neptr</b>: Ha ha! Neat!
</dd>,<dd>[<i>They turn to look at Blue Nose's hat, and the episode ends.</i>]

</dd>,<dd><b>Jake</b>:  Yeah. Ladies are twisty, man. Bubblegum's super smart, too.
</dd>,<dd><b>Finn</b>:  I <i>know</i>! And I can't shake this weird feeling about Ricardio. I think he's... a villain.
</dd>,<dd><b>Jake</b>:  Why? Is it because his face is so foldy and dramatic?
</dd>,<dd><b>Finn</b>:  No! I can just feel it in my gut! He's up to something sinister!
</dd>,<dd><b>Jake</b>:  Maybe what you feel is romantic rivalry.
</dd>,<dd><b>Finn</b>:  I'll <i>prove</i> he's a villain!
</dd>,<dd><b>Jake</b>:  How?

</dd>,<dd><b>Jake</b>:  <i>Is</i> it? Don't get me wrong. I'm all about stakeouts and spying on this guy, but what if he's not a villain? What if he just <i>looks</i> wicked? Some people look wicked but are super nice.
</dd>,<dd><b>Finn</b>:  I gotta trust my gut!
</dd>,<dd><b>Jake</b>:  [<i>Grabbing gut</i>] Hmm.
</dd>,<dd><b>Finn</b>:  He's on the move! Let's roll! [<i>The two swing onto a <a href=""/wiki/Gumball_Guardian"" title=""Gumball Guardian"">Guardian of the Royal Promise</a>.</i>] I see 'im. He's holding rope and going into the trash. He's smashing bottles—and pretending to stab someone!
</dd>,<dd><b>Jake</b>:  So... he's recycling... or what?
</dd>,<dd><b>Finn</b>:  [<i>Takes off binoculars</i>] I think your gut's a little naive, Jake. [<i>Puts on binoculars</i>] Holy moly! He's... he's with the Ice King! They're shouting something! [<i>Ice King and Ricardio quarrel.</i>] Ricardio is tossing him in the dumpster and running away!
</dd>,<dd><b>Jake</b>:  So I was right! He <i>is</i> a good guy who's just cursed to look suspicious! [<i>To gut</i>] You and me, gut! Together forever! Solvin' crimes and makin' up rhymes!
</dd>,<dd><b>Finn</b>:  No way. This proves he's a <i>super</i>-villain! More powerful than lesser villains like the Ice King!
</dd>,<dd>[<i>Jake sings the <a href=""/wiki/Gut_Song"" title=""Gut Song"">Gut Song</a>.</i>]
</dd>,<dd><b>Finn</b>:  Then it's settled! We're gonna confront Ricardio face-to-face and prove he's evil!

</dd>,<dd><b>Princess Bubblegum</b>:  Finn... why'd you do it?
</dd>,<dd><b>Finn</b>:  He was gonna hurt you with those ropes and bottles!
</dd>,<dd><b>Princess Bubblegum</b>:  These were for our balbaflonic laser.
</dd>,<dd><b>Ricardio</b>:  It's not all his fault, Princess. I might've looked a little threatening.
</dd>,<dd><b>Princess Bubblegum</b>:  Finn... you shouldn't punch brainiacs. You know how fragile they are! You gotta stop this jealous business.
</dd>,<dd><b>Finn</b>:  But...
</dd>,<dd><b>Princess Bubblegum</b>:  C'mon, Ricardio. I'll patch you up and give you candy. [<i>They exit.</i>]

[<i>Ricardio come's out of Ice King's chest in flashback. He runs towards the window laughing.</i>] He planned to rip out Princess Bubblegum's heart... to make it his bride. [<i>Ricardio sticks his tongue out and exits laughing.</i>] Without my heart, I grew weak. [<i>Ice King groans in flashback.</i>] But I made my way to the Candy Kingdom to look for him. In an alleyway, I begged him to [<i>In flashback, Ice King mouths these words as current Ice King says them</i>] return to me and leave the princess alone.

</dd>,<dd><b>Rattleballs</b>: No. When I was a young robot, I went horseback riding. No one taught me how to post. The horse took a crazy jump, and I came down on the saddle hard. One of my gumballs bounced up inside me. It's been lodged in a weird spot for years.
</dd>,<dd><b>Finn</b>: Oh, here. [<i>Finn summons his grass sword which becomes bent. Finn inserts his sword in the hole of Rattleballs. He jiggles his sword and attempts to loosen the gumball</i>]

</dd>,<dd><b>Finn</b>: What the—?! [<i>He looks upon a piece of wood left of the shed, in the shape of Finn</i>]

</dd>,<dd><b>Rattleballs</b>: That, my friend, is a long tale... which I will tell you now. [<i>flashback begins of the Candy Kingdom under construction</i>] It was a much wilder time in the Candy Kingdom. I was a member of an elite robot police force created by Princess Bubblegum. Her previous attempts at law enforcement had been a bunch of goofs. [<i>the flashback shows a rock shop. A rock person breaks out of the window, holding rocks, and keeps running</i>]
</dd>,<dd><b>Shop Owner</b>: Stop Him!
</dd>,<dd><b>Banana Guards</b>: Go! Go! Go! Go! [<i> A robot slices the rock person into pieces with his sword and was put into a big pile of broken rock people</i>]
</dd>,<dd><b>Rattleballs</b>: Our righteous swords cut a swath through the chaos, but we were too successful. [<i>The flashback shows a hooded figure entering through a door on the side of a building, guarded by robots</i>] Unfortunately, we were still programmed for violence. [<i>the flashback shows robots surrounding a wrestling ring. In the ring, a robot and Rattleballs charged at each other. Rattleballs sliced the other robot to pieces with its sword.

</dd>,<dd><b>Princess Bubblegum</b>: One, two, one, two, one, two, one, two. Okay, robots, all the number ones, go stand on that platform over there. And all the number twos, just turn around and face the wall. [<i>All the robots assigned as number twos turned around and faced the wall</i>] And no peeking!
</dd>,<dd><b>Rattleballs</b>: We were programmed to follow her commands 100%, but through sheer force of will, I was able to overcome it. [<i>Rattleballs tries to look behind him to see all the robots assigned number one, squished into one metal cube on the platform</i>] We had been judged too dangerous to stay operational and sentenced to death! [<i>the banana guards take the metal cube away</i>]

</dd>,<dd><b>Rattleballs</b>: I alone escaped, while my compatriots became minimalist furniture. [<i>motions to metal cube</i>]
</dd>,<dd><b>Finn</b>: Oh, sorry! [<i>stands up off the metal cube</i>]
</dd>,<dd><b>Rattleballs</b>: I've lived as a fugitive in this junkyard ever since. That is why you must never tell Princess Bubblegum about me. If she ever found out, she would have me destroyed.
</dd>,<dd>[<i>Next scene immediately shows Princess Bubblegum</i>]
</dd>,<dd><b>Princess Bubblegum</b>: Rattleballs is still what?!
</dd>,<dd><b>Finn</b>: He asked me not to tell you, but I cannot break my oath to serve you, my lady, 100%.

</dd>,<dd>[<i>Next scene, Rattleballs is seen watering some plants in the junkyard and then waters the metal cube. Rattleballs sighs to see Finn, Princess Bubblegum, Root Beer Guy and 20 Banana Guards surrounding him</i>]
</dd>,<dd><b>Rattleballs</b>: Hello, Princess.
</dd>,<dd><b>Finn</b>: Sorry Ree-B-Z. My oath to the princess comes first, but once you two talk it out, I know she'll see you mean no harm.
</dd>,<dd><b>Princess Bubblegum</b>: Banana Guards, destroy!
</dd>,<dd><b>Rattleballs</b>: So be it! [<i>Rattleballs grabs for his sword</i>]
</dd>,<dd><b>Finn</b>: Wait! [<i>The Banana Guards charge at Rattleballs</i>]
</dd>,<dd><b>Banana Guards</b>: CHARGE! [<i>Rattleballs takes out his sword, and circled the sword on the ground to dust the air.</i>] WEEWOOWEEWOO! [<i>Rattleballs charges at a Banana Guard.

</dd>,<dd><b>Rattleballs</b>: Rattleballs! [<i>Rattleballs lands in front of Princess Bubblegum and points his sword at her. The dust cloud clears</i>]
</dd>,<dd><b>Finn</b>: RB, don't!
</dd>,<dd><b>Rattleballs</b>: You think I'm dangerous, Princess?
</dd>,<dd><b>Princess Bubblegum</b>: Dang right I do! You killed all my banana guards!
</dd>,<dd><b>Finn</b>: No, Princess, look! They're only bruised!
</dd>,<dd><b>Banana Guards</b>: Hey, you hit me!
</dd>,<dd><b>Rattleballs</b>: I no longer crave mindless violence. I have found peace in meditation, gardening, egg throwing. I also hope time has made you less bloodthirsty, princess, but do with me as you will. In my heart I still serve you, 100%.
</dd>,<dd>[<i>Next scene shows five bandaged banana guards sitting on a couch, watching TV</i>]

</dd>,<dd><b>Princess Bubblegum</b>: Everything's settled. I don't have to go back on my order, and you can protect the kingdom from the shadows.
</dd>,<dd><b>Rattleballs</b>: Thank you, Princess. That's marginally better than hiding in a dump. [<i>He is about to jump out of the window</i>]
</dd>,<dd><b>Princess Bubblegum</b>: Wait! [<i>she comes closer to Rattleballs and blesses him with the sword</i>] I dub thee Sir Rattleballs! [<i>Rattleballs smiles as Princess Bubblegum hands Rattleballs his sword. He flies out of the window.</i>]

</dd>,<dd><b><a href=""/wiki/Finn"" title=""Finn"">Finn</a></b>:  Uuf! [<i>BMO falls on his head and <a href=""/wiki/CMO"" title=""CMO"">CMO</a> falls on BMO's head.</i>]

</dd>,<dd><b>Finn</b>:  Come on, Jake...
</dd>,<dd><b>Jake</b>:  Sorry buddy, [<i>changes into his normal form</i>] just trying to cheer you up some. I mean here you are chillin' out with history's coolest friends, building an actual pillow fort, but you just sit there sulking--I mean, what gives!?
</dd>,<dd><b>Finn</b>:  [<i>sigh</i>] I guess I'm just thinking about <a href=""/wiki/Flame_Princess"" title=""Flame Princess"">Flame Princess</a>. I told her a joke the other day and she didn't even laugh or anything. I guess it's over between us.
</dd>,<dd><b>Jake</b>:  That's it?! A joke?
</dd>,<dd><b>BMO</b>:  Maybe she just didn't get it yet.
</dd>,<dd><b>Finn</b>:  Yeah right, BMO. More like she used up all her laughs on some other guy's jokes probably. Man, having a girlfriend is hard.
</dd>,<dd><b>Jake</b>:  No! Being crazy is hard. You're getting all hung up, all hung up on imaginary problems. You gotta focus on what's real, man. [<i>Grabs a cup.</i>] You see this cup? This is literally my favorite cup. [<i>He throws it through the window, shattering the window.</i>] Now it's gone forever. So it's not real, and I don't care about it anymore.
</dd>,<dd><b>BMO</b>:  [<i>gasp</i>] Oh no! My favorite window!
</dd>,<dd><b>Finn</b>:  I don't even know <i>what</i> you guys are talking about. I think I just need some alone time. [<i>Grabs his cup and sword.</i>] Gotta let my mind fester a bit, you know? I'll be back in a little while. [<i>Finn enters the pillow fort.</i>]
</dd>,<dd><b>Jake</b>:  [<i>Jake shouts this as Finn is getting further and further inside the pillow fort.</i>] Finn! Festering is always bad, man! There's no good kind of festering! Finn!
</dd>,<dd><b>Finn</b>:  Man, this looked smaller from the outside. What's this now? What the?! Jake, what's in here?! Jake?
</dd>,<dd>[<i>Finn comes out from a small door... and into a new realm: <a href=""/wiki/Pillow_World"" title=""Pillow World"">Pillow World</a>.</i>]
</dd>,<dd><b>Finn</b>:  Oh, whoa! [<i>birds chirping</i>] Did Jake build this part too? That guy needs some more girlfriends or something.
</dd>,<dd><b>Finn</b>:  [<i>Turns towards the door, which has inexplicably disappeared.</i>] Hey Jake! You need more girlf--what the...? Door's gone?
</dd>,<dd><b>Finn</b>:  Hmm, maybe there's another door in yonder pillow town. [<i>Slides towards pillow town</i>] I don't get this at all.

</dd>,<dd><b>Pillow child</b>:  Wow.

</dd>,<dd><b>Roselinen</b>:  [<i>laughs</i>] [<i>playfully hits Finn on the cheeks</i>] Dummy, it's a <i>dance</i>, not marriage.
</dd>,<dd><b>Finn</b>:  [<i>laughs nervously</i>] Yeah, okay! [<i>The pillow bird poops a little pillowcase on Finn's shoulders.</i>] This place is weird.
</dd>,<dd><b>Roselinen</b>:  [<i>Walking on the dance floor.</i>] Are you telling me that birds in <a href=""/wiki/Land_of_Ooo"" title=""Land of Ooo"">your world</a> don't poo little pillowcases?
</dd>,<dd><b>Finn</b>:  Naah, just regular poo.
</dd>,<dd><b>Roselinen</b>:  Hey, like this. [<i>She grabs his hand and places it on her hip, which absorbs it.</i>]
</dd>,<dd><b>Finn</b>:  Eh, yeah, i-it's really cool. Where I come from, I live with my best friend, who's my brother. And he's a dog.[<i>chuckles</i>] We fight stuff; it's cool. It's really different than here. I mean, where I'm from, blankets and pillows are used for bedding.
</dd>,<dd><b>Roselinen</b>:  [<i>laughs</i>] Well they're used for that here too.
</dd>,<dd><b>Finn</b>:  [<i>Blushes then laughs nervously.</i>] Heh heh uh.

</dd>,<dd><b>Finn</b>:  Ah man, it's been nice, Roselinen. But I gotta get back to my home. [<i>turns to Quilton.</i>] Quilton, I need your help to find a portal to my home world.
</dd>,<dd><b>Quilton</b>:  Of course, we will do our best to help you, Finn the Flesh Pillow. But you're not making a fold of sense!
</dd>,<dd>[<i>A pillow person presents some pillow food.</i>]
</dd>,<dd><b>Quilton</b>:  Please, share our food. You need nourishment.
</dd>,<dd><b>Finn</b>:  [<i>eating a pillow</i>] [<i>muffled</i>] It tastes... like... a pillow...
</dd>,<dd><b>Quilton</b>:  I'll give your compliments to the pillow.

</dd>,<dd>[<i>The scene switches back to the Tree Fort. Jake fishes his favorite cup that he threw it out the window.</i>]
</dd>,<dd><b>BMO</b>:  Oh, there you are! You found your mug. I thought you said you didn't care.
</dd>,<dd><b>Jake</b>:  [<i>sips the cup</i>]
</dd>,<dd><b>BMO</b>:  That mug is empty.
</dd>,<dd><b>Jake</b>:  I wonder what Finn's up to...
</dd>,<dd>[<i>The scene returns to Pillow World. The presence of Jay and Bonnie, Finn's and Roselinen's children, re-enacting Finn's battle with the Blanket Dragon, is a dead giveaway of the fact time has passed.</i>]

</dd>,<dd><b>Quilton</b>:  Oh oh oh, come here! Oh, but I've come to speak with your father.
</dd>,<dd><b>Finn</b>:  What is it, Quilton?
</dd>,<dd><b>Quilton</b>:  When you first arrived here, you told us of a mysterious door that led you to our world.
</dd>,<dd><b>Finn</b>:  Yes, of course.

</dd>,<dd><b>Finn</b>:  Oh my glob.
</dd>,<dd><b>Quilton</b>:  There is no information about the door, save for the fact it shows up periodically, and then disappears.
</dd>,<dd>[<i>Roselinen watches them from the background while their kids are enjoying their pillow lunches.</i>]
</dd>,<dd><b>Finn</b>:  Quilton, I need to find that door. [<i>Roselinen makes a very sad face</i>]
</dd>,<dd>[<i>The scene changes to the Tree Fort again, where BMO and Jake's favorite cup are wearing rainbow afro wigs.</i>]

</dd>,<dd><b>Finn</b>:  Are these The Great Abracadabra Mountains? And are you Rasheeta the Great Oracle, dweller of said mountains?
</dd>,<dd><b>Rasheeta</b>:  Yes, you must be Finn the Human Man, seeker of the wandering portal.
</dd>,<dd><b>Finn</b>:  Yes, I've searched for decades--how did you know?
</dd>,<dd><b>Rasheeta</b>:  I've read it in the <i>Tea Leaves</i>, [<i>grabs a newspaper</i>] this newspaper I found from the future.
</dd>,<dd><b>Finn</b>:  Does it say how I get home?
</dd>,<dd><b>Rasheeta</b>:  The real question is: are you sure you want to?
</dd>,<dd><b>Finn</b>:  Uh... yeah!

</dd>,<dd><b>Finn</b>:  Oh... [<i>coughing from the stench of Rasheeta's farting, he leaves the tent.</i>]
</dd>,<dd><b>Bonnie</b>:  Father?
</dd>,<dd><b>Jay</b>:  What did the oracle say, father? Have we come to the right spot finally?
</dd>,<dd><b>Finn</b>:  I think so, but the oracle spoke in riddles. [<i>stroking his beard</i>] Gonna have to fester on this one for a bit...
</dd>,<dd><b>Roselinen</b>:  Oh, Finn. I know you have to go, all these years I've known, but now that it's time... [<i>sniffles then starts crying.</i>] Oh man, I'm just all messed up about it. Just promise me you'll remember us, [<i>wipes her tears.</i>] when you're back in your real life.
</dd>,<dd>[<i>Finn sheds a few tears then strokes his beard.</i>]
</dd>,<dd><b>Finn</b>:  Hmm, that reminds me, Roselinen, of something Jake told me just before I came to this world.
</dd>,<dd>[<i>Shows a flashback of Jake when he was explaining that he needs to deal with his real problems.</i>]
</dd>,<dd><b>Jake</b>:  [<i>distorted voice while strangely looking different</i>] You're getting all hung up on imaginary problems, stay with your new wife. You've known her longer now than any of us. You're not even sure if I ever really existed. And I'm pretty sure I didn't look like <i>this</i>.
</dd>,<dd><b>Finn</b>:  [<i>to himself</i>] Man. How did he see it all coming so clearly? [<i>to family</i>] Come on, everyone. Pack your things, we're going home.
</dd>,<dd>[<i>The scene changes to the real world where Jake was playing with BMO.</i>]
</dd>,<dd><b>BMO</b>:  [<i>laughing</i>] Ha ha he, ha ha he, goodness, Jake, why don't you do this with your <a href=""/wiki/Jake_and_Lady%27s_offspring_(disambiguation)"" title=""Jake and Lady's offspring (disambiguation)"">other babies</a>?
</dd>,<dd><b>Jake</b>:  Well, <a href=""/wiki/Rainicorns"" title=""Rainicorns"">Rainicorn</a> babies age rapidly. They don't need their parents a couple hours after they're born.
</dd>,<dd><b>BMO</b>:  That really stinks, huh?
</dd>,<dd><b>Jake</b>:  Mmmmm.
</dd>,<dd><b>BMO</b>:  Hot chocolate is ready!

Princess Day/Transcript ,"<dd>[<i>Episode opens at the Breakfast Kingdom</i>]
</dd>,<dd><b>Breakfast Princess</b>: We are delighted to host this year's Princess Day in Breakfast Kingdom! Please enjoy the continental breakfast expertly prepared by our Breakfast Chefs. Now, on to more pressing matters. Brigands have been attacking our western seaports, dozens of unregistered princesses roam the land, and trade deficits are at an all-time high. Historically, Breakfast Kingdom has traded one sack of sugar a month to <a href=""/wiki/Slime_Kingdom"" title=""Slime Kingdom"">Slime Kingdom</a> in exchange for four eggs, but egg production has plummeted!
</dd>,<dd><b>Slime Princess</b>: I can't just pop out eggs on command! I'm an artisan!
</dd>,<dd><b>Breakfast Princess</b>: You have an egg in you right now.
</dd>,<dd><b>Slime Princess</b>: [<i>gasps, covers the egg</i>] How dare you?
</dd>,<dd><b>Muscle Princess</b>: Yeah, and what about that peanut juice, Peanut Princess? My body needs juice!
</dd>,<dd><b>Peanut Princess</b>: I'm not giving out a single drop of nut butter. Not until Raggedy Princess pays me!
</dd>,<dd><b>Raggedy Princess</b>: Fine! Take it! [<i>starts pulling socks out of her eye</i>] Take all my socks!
</dd>,<dd><b>Peanut Princess</b>: You still owe me a pair of jorts!
</dd>,<dd><b>Lumpy Space Princess</b>: [<i>bored, arguing is heard through the room</i>] Aaah! [<i>hits her arms on the table</i>] You guys, I'm bored out of my face! I make a motion to stop talking about dumb stuff that's lame!
</dd>,<dd><b>Breakfast Princess</b>: Oh, Lumpy Space Princess, I'm afraid you'll have to be patient with us and our petty disputes. Not all of us have achieved the self-sufficiency that I assume you have in your kingdom. [<i>gasps</i>] Oh wait, that's right. You don't have a kingdom! You live in a box in the woods.
</dd>,<dd><b>Lumpy Space Princess</b>: It's not a box. It's a rotting log.
</dd>,<dd><b>Breakfast Princess</b>: [<i>scoffs</i>] Sorry, LSP, but the chair only recognizes real princesses, not bums.
</dd>,<dd><b>Lumpy Space Princess</b>: What?! I'm like a cool hippie!
</dd>,<dd><b>Breakfast Princess</b>: Whatever, freeloader. If you <i>were</i> invited to Princess Day, it must have been a mistake or as a joke. Am I right, girls?
</dd>,<dd><b>Strudel Princess</b>: [<i>sitting behind Breakfast Princess</i>] Ohh!
</dd>,<dd><b>Lumpy Space Princess</b>: The joke's on you because I <i>wasn't</i> invited. I'm crashing! And I already ate a bunch of your food! What you gonna do about it, Princess <i>Egg Breath</i>?

</dd>,<dd><b>Cinnamon Bun</b>: [<i>leans by Flame Princess</i>] That's true. She <i>does</i> have egg breath.

</dd>,<dd><b>Breakfast Princess</b>: Okay, I'll handle it. [<i>turns to everyone in the hall</i>] Fellow princesses, I got to deal with matters of state. My little sister, Strudel Princess, will take over for me.

</dd>,<dd><b>Cookie</b>: [<i>exits store</i>] No... no! [<i>brandishing cudgel</i>] Don't play games with me, Princess. I want that crown. No crown, no hostages.

</dd>,<dd><b>Cookie</b>: No, Princess! You are problem—the problem princess! [<i>beat</i>] Just gimme that crown! [<i>goes back inside</i>]
</dd>,<dd><b>Jake</b>: Why does he want your crown anyway, Princess?
</dd>,<dd><b>Finn</b>: Yeah, what's <i>his</i> beef?
</dd>,<dd><b>Princess Bubblegum</b>: I don't know, guys—he's crazy. He's left me no choice. I'm sending in the banana guards. It's about to turn <i>crazy</i> nasty.

</dd>,<dd><b>Princess Bubblegum</b>: Hmm. Okay, but if you guys aren't out of there by [<i>points to her watch</i>] 4:00, I'm sending in the guards.
</dd>,<dd><b>Jake</b>: [<i>to Finn</i>] Okay, I was thinkin' I could [<i>shape-shifts to look like a mailman</i>] dress up like a mailman.
</dd>,<dd><b>Finn</b>: Yeah. Yeah, and I could wear all black and I could be like, you know, like, <i>your shadow</i>.
</dd>,<dd><b>Princess Bubblegum</b>: Hmm. I can't really see that working.
</dd>,<dd><b>Jake</b>: Yeah, the shadow thing might be pushin' it.
</dd>,<dd><b>Princess Bubblegum</b>: Oh, no-no-no, that part's fine. I was talking about you dressing up like a mailman.
</dd>,<dd><b>Jake</b>: What? But I always wanted to be a mailman.
</dd>,<dd><b>Princess Bubblegum</b>: Nah, you don't look like a mailman. You look like a <i>milk</i>man. Let's get you a proper milkman outfit.

</dd>,<dd><b>Cookie</b>: Huh? Oh. I thought maybe you were a spy guy or somethin'. Go ahead, give everyone some milk, then get the math outta here.
</dd>,<dd><b>Jake</b>: Yes, sir. [<i>starts passing out bottles of milk to the hostages</i>] Milk, sir?
</dd>,<dd><b>Marshmallow</b>: Thanks.

</dd>,<dd><b>Finn</b>: Psst! Get ready, Jake. When we get to the cookie, you throw some milk in his face and yell, ""Alvin's hot juice box. Alvin's hot juice box."" He'll be really confused, and that's when we grab him and tie him up-style.
</dd>,<dd>[<i>Static is heard coming from Cookie's radio.</i>]

</dd>,<dd><b>Chipler</b>: Affirmative. [<i>jumps away</i>]
</dd>,<dd><b>Jake</b>: Did you hear that?
</dd>,<dd><b>Finn</b>: Yeah. Change of plans—I'll go take care of those chips. You keep the cookie distracted.
</dd>,<dd><b>Jake</b>: Yeah. I can do that.
</dd>,<dd><b>Finn</b>: Okay, awesome.
</dd>,<dd>[<i>Finn scoots along the floor toward the back of the store as Jake continues handing out milk.</i>]
</dd>,<dd><b>Jake</b>: Milk? Milk? [<i>approaches Cookie</i>] Milk? [<i>sits next to him</i>] Some milk?
</dd>,<dd><b>Cookie</b>: What? Oh. Look, you should probably split, buddy. Things are about to get pretty flipped out in here.
</dd>,<dd><b>Jake</b>: Oh, sure. Sorry, man. I was just trying to get away from that rotten Princess Bubblegum for a while, y'know? Isn't she just the worst?
</dd>,<dd><b>Cookie</b>: Wait, you hate Princess Bubblegum, too? Get outta here!
</dd>,<dd><b>Jake</b>: Oh, yeah, man, she's the worst. Sittin' out there all safe and cozy while I'm riskin' my life tootin' around in here in this stupid milkman costume.
</dd>,<dd><b>Cookie</b>: [<i>beat</i>] Wait—costume?!
</dd>,<dd><b>Jake</b>: Oh, um... I just mean it <i>feels</i> like a costume... 'cause I wanted to be a mailman so bad, ya see? But the princess—she made me be a milkman anyway.

</dd>,<dd><b>Cookie</b>: [<i>sighs</i>] I was just a kid, man, just a little kid, when <i>I</i> got doodied on.
</dd>,<dd>[<i>Flashback begins, showing several candy children lying around in a room with cracks in the walls.</i>]
</dd>,<dd><b>Cookie [<i>voiceover</i>]</b>: I was the new guy at the <a href=""/wiki/Candy_Orphanage"" title=""Candy Orphanage"">Candy Orphanage</a>. They called me Baby Snaps. I tried to make friends with the other kids...
</dd>,<dd><b>Baby Snaps</b>: [<i>dancing</i>] C'mon, guys, let's dance it up!

</dd>,<dd><b>Cookie</b>: Everything was-was <i>better</i> with her around. And something inside me changed that day, too. And then later she told me I could be anything I wanted.
</dd>,<dd><b>Princess Bubblegum</b>: Anything your sweet heart desires!
</dd>,<dd><b>Cookie</b>: And I told her I wanted to be a princess like her, so I could make all the children happy.
</dd>,<dd><b>Baby Snaps</b>: [<i>on Princess Bubblegum's lap</i>] I wanna be a princess like you!
</dd>,<dd><b>Princess Bubblegum</b>: [<i>stifles a giggle</i>]
</dd>,<dd>[<i>Baby Snaps' smile changes to a shocked frown.</i>]
</dd>,<dd><b>Cookie</b>: And she <i>laughed in my face</i>, man! It really messed me up.
</dd>,<dd>[<i>Flashback ends and Cookie is now crying silently.</i>]
</dd>,<dd><b>Jake</b>: Holy shmow, man. That's terrible. That's <i>really</i> terrible. Listen, I—
</dd>,<dd><b>Cookie</b>: [<i>cries</i>] She LIED to me!
</dd>,<dd><b>Jake</b>: Yeah, but, maybe she didn't realize how much it meant to you.
</dd>,<dd><b>Cookie</b>: [<i>stands up</i>] No, she just wants to hog all the princessin' for herself! [<i>to radio</i>] All chips, report in. It's time to get real! Over. [<i>no response</i>] Chips.

[<i>smashes radio on the ground</i>] AAAAH! [<i>pants heavily</i>] I'm about to flip out, man... and <i>take</i> that crown!
</dd>,<dd><b>Jake</b>: Whoa, whoa, wait! It doesn't have to be like this! You don't need that crown. You could start over, man. You can start a new kingdom—your own kingdom... where everyone can be whatever they wanna be. I can be the mailman... and <i>you</i>? You can be the princess. And—
</dd>,<dd><b>Cookie</b>: My own kingdom?
</dd>,<dd><b>Jake</b>: Yeah, man.
</dd>,<dd><b>Cookie</b>: I... I'd <i>like</i> that.
</dd>,<dd><b>Jake</b>: Okay, then. Just sit tight, Princess. I'll get us outta here. [<i>walks to the front of the store and waves through the glass doors.</i>] Hey! Hey! I'm comin' out!
</dd>,<dd><b>Princess Bubblegum</b>: What?
</dd>,<dd>[<i>Jake walks out through the doors toward her.</i>]
</dd>,<dd><b>Princess Bubblegum</b>: Jake? Jake, what's going on? Where's Finn? Where are the hostages?
</dd>,<dd><b>Jake</b>: Don't worry, Princess. It's okay now. Princess Cookie's gonna go away. You just gotta give him a horse to escape with and he'll go.
</dd>,<dd><b>Princess Bubblegum</b>: Right... and then you and Finn hunt him down and put him in the <a href=""/wiki/Candy_Dungeon"" title=""Candy Dungeon"">dungeon</a>.
</dd>,<dd><b>Jake</b>: No, wait. He said he'd go away forever. Can't we just let him go?
</dd>,<dd><b>Princess Bubblegum</b>: No. That cookie is a menace. Once the hostages are safe, Cookie goes in my dungeon—in my dungeon for his life.
</dd>,<dd><b>Jake</b>: [<i>sighs</i>]

</dd>,<dd><b>Finn</b>: What? But-but he's a criminal!
</dd>,<dd><b>Jake</b>: No, man, Princess Cookie's a good guy. He just got dealt a bad hand. He's only trying to be what following how his dreams make you want to be, man!

</dd>,<dd><b>Cookie</b>: You know what? It's funny, but you sort of remind me of a mailman I used to know.

[<i>A Banana Guard walking by looks over at Finn and Jake, surprised by the outburst, then moves on.</i>]

</dd>,<dd><b>Finn</b>: They're not?!
</dd>,<dd><b>Jake</b>: Nah, man. Listen. Here on our planet, back in the old days, back in the REAL old days, it was just every man for hisself. Scrooblin' and scrat-scroblin' for the good stuff, the greenest valleys, and scrat-scroblin'. And the strongest, meanest men got the best stuff. They got the green valleys and were like, ""The rest of you, y'all scrats get sand!"" And THAT'S when they made the laws, you see. Once the strong guys got it how they liked it, they said, ""This is fair now, this is the law."" Once they were winning, they changed the rules up.
</dd>,<dd><b>Finn</b>: Woah, just like Kim Kil Whan!
</dd>,<dd><b>Banana Guard</b>: Hey, good news, fellas. [<i>Unlocks Finn and Jake's handcuffs.</i>] Your bail's paid. You're free to go.

</dd>,<dd><b>Kim Kil Whan</b>: This is a bill for the bail I just paid.
</dd>,<dd><b>Jake</b>: [<i>In shock at the amount.</i>] Ooh. [<i>Jake slides down Kim Kil Whan and plops on the floor.</i>]
</dd>,<dd><b>Kim Kil Whan</b>: You're really in it deep here, Dad. It's time for you to get real, get a job. No more games.

</dd>,<dd><b>Jake</b>: [<i>Sighs.</i>] Man, where did I go wrong?
</dd>,<dd><b>Finn</b>: I don't know. But I'm not tryin' to be sleepin' on a ladder anymore, so let's just get a bunch of scroot together and buy our house back. Then you two can hash it out later.
</dd>,<dd><b>Jake</b>: [<i>Finn and Jake stop walking.</i>] Yeah, you're right. So, wanna rob a bank or somethin'?
</dd>,<dd><b>Finn</b>: Well, actually...I was thinking maybe Kim Kil Whan was right. [<i>Finn shrugs.</i>] Maybe we should get jobs or somethin'.
</dd>,<dd><b>Jake</b>: Oh yeah.... Yeah. Oh no, wait! I just remembered I buried a ton of gold in the front yard!
</dd>,<dd><b>Finn</b>: Yuss!!
</dd>,<dd><b>Kim Kil Whan</b>: [<i>Scene changes to the tree house, where Kim Kil Whan stands in Finn and Jake's bedroom, talking to a creature sitting on Finn's bed.</i>] Oh yes, yes, absolutely. Small pets are allowed with an additional deposit. [<i>A dog pops out from the creature and barks.</i>] Excellent.

</dd>,<dd><b>Bubblegum</b>: What the dip, Marceline?
</dd>,<dd><b>Marceline</b>: Sorry. It was supposed to be a joke. Actually, I have something really serious to ask. I want you to do the procedure, the one we talked about.
</dd>,<dd><b>Bubblegum</b>: I'm sorry, but I don't think you'd make a good blonde.

</dd>,<dd><b>Bubblegum</b>: [Sighs] Well, the machine is built and the serums are ready, but are you sure you want to do this?
</dd>,<dd><b>Marceline</b>: I'm sure. Some bad things happened to me when I was little. When I became a vampire, I was just a messed-up kid. Now it's 1,000 years later, and I'm still messed up. [<i>Peppermint Butler nods</i>] I don't want to spend eternity like this, with this emptiness. I want to grow up.

</dd>,<dd><b>Blargetha</b>: My husband would like to say something. And, uh, he would, too, if not for his extremely sore throat. So I will say it for him. We challenge you to the <a href=""/wiki/Trials_of_Glarb"" title=""Trials of Glarb"">Trials of Glarb</a>.
</dd>,<dd><b>Slime People</b>: [<i>gasp</i>]
</dd>,<dd><b>Slime Princess</b>: I object! Ancient traditions such as the Trials of Glarb are no longer relevant in our modern self-indulgent society.
</dd>,<dd><b>Elder Plops</b>: [<i>entering on a third balcony</i>] Order, order! I demand order. I, Elder Plops, being the coolest guy in the room, will settle this dispute. The matter will be settled on the battleground...
</dd>,<dd><b>Finn</b>: Alright!
</dd>,<dd><b>Elder Plops</b>: ...the battleground of love.
</dd>,<dd><b>Finn</b>: Aw.
</dd>,<dd><b>Elder Plops</b>: The couple that I deem most truly in love shall rule the Slime Kingdom for life. [<i>taps scepter</i>] Plops out. [<i>exits balcony</i>]
</dd>,<dd><b>Finn</b>: [<i>sighs</i>]
</dd>,<dd><b>Jake</b>: This is, like, the opposite of what you wanted.
</dd>,<dd>[<i>Scene cuts to the four contestants and Elder Plops standing on a dock with two swan boats in a lagoon.</i>]
</dd>,<dd><b>Elder Plops</b>: Welcome to the Trials of Glarb, hosted by me, Elder Plops. The first trial will be Crooning. You guys are gonna get into these sweet boats I made and croon for each other on the lake. The most loving and heartfelt song, judged by me, Elder Plops, will win.
</dd>,<dd>[<i>Finn and Slime Princess climb into a boat.</i>]
</dd>,<dd><b>Elder Plops</b>: I really want to hear some emotional song work here. The people want to hear emotional stuff. So let's see some stuff, alright? [<i>claps thrice</i>]
</dd>,<dd>[<i>The contestants row their boats out into the lake.</i>]
</dd>,<dd><b>Slime Princess</b>: Okay, Finn, you can do it.
</dd>,<dd><b>Finn</b>: I don't know. I'm still jacked up over my lady biz.
</dd>,<dd><b>Slime Princess</b>: Well, just lose yourself in your own mind and go numb. Then let it all out.
</dd>,<dd><b>Finn</b>: Eh. [<i>exhales deeply</i>] Okay. Just let it all out. [<i>sings ""<a href=""/wiki/I_Just_Can%27t_Get_Over_You"" title=""I Just Can't Get Over You"">I Just Can't Get Over You</a>""</i>] Why can't I get over you?
</dd>,<dd><b>Elder Plops</b>: Finn, way to go. I could tell the people were really impressed. Guillermo, you're up.
</dd>,<dd><b>Blargetha</b>: Hmm? Okay, Guillermo. I'll ask, I'll ask. Uh, Guillermo still has a sore throat! Uh, may I sing on, uh, his behalf?
</dd>,<dd><b>Elder Plops</b>: Elder Plops thinks that's okay.

</dd>,<dd><b>Slime Princess</b>: Is it because you haven't done much kissing? You don't have to be embarrassed by your innocence.
</dd>,<dd><b>Finn</b>: Pretending to be in love is making me sad. It makes me think about Flame Princess.

</dd>,<dd><b>Finn</b>: That's worse, I think.
</dd>,<dd><b>Slime Princess</b>: Well, it looks like I'm losing my kingdom to the forces of evil.

</dd>,<dd><b>Finn</b>: Guillermo! [<i>punches him, apparently killing him</i>] Hyuh! [<i>gasps</i>] Are you dead, man? Aw, jeez, bro. [<i>picks up one of his ""eyes""</i>] Huh? These are olives.
</dd>,<dd><b>Blargetha</b>: Uh-oh.
</dd>,<dd><b>Slime Princess</b>: Blargetha, why would you make a fake husband? You're so hot.
</dd>,<dd><b>Blargetha</b>: You don't know how hard it is to be this hot. Women don't want to talk to you, because they're intimidated, and guys don't want to talk to you, because they're too scared. You're alone in the hottest, most sexiest prison. So I stuck some olives in a glob of gelatin and called it my lover.
</dd>,<dd><b>Finn</b>: Well, I'm sorry, Blargetha, but you're going to have to spend more time in your metaphorical prison in a real prison 'cause what you're doing is illegal.

</dd>,<dd><b>Leaf Beard</b>: Oh. You're not from the roots.
</dd>,<dd><b>Kent</b>: I'm from my brother's butt. Maybe.

</dd>,<dd><b>Leaf Beard</b>: So sick, nasty bad.
</dd>,<dd><b>Kent</b>: That means I got to fight him. That's what my brother said to do! Where's my sword?
</dd>,<dd><b>Leaf Beard</b>: Your sword was shattered to butts when I found you.

</dd>,<dd><b>Leaf Beard</b>: Yes. Bums.
</dd>,<dd><b>Kent</b>: What do I do?
</dd>,<dd><b>Leaf Beard</b>: Um...I don't know. But the blacksmith could make you a new one, probably.
</dd>,<dd><b>Dewdrop</b>: That's who I am. And I am very good at me. Okay, so, like, the rat king has been messing up the roots, yeah? Chewing on them with his teeth.

</dd>,<dd><b>Kent</b>: Nah, I don't care about being a good husband or wife or whatever. All's I care about is fighting bad guys.

</dd>,<dd><b>Kent</b>: Um...I was born earlier today, so I don't really get a sense of my own mortality. No, thank you.

</dd>,<dd><b>Kent</b>: [<i>turns around</i>] Who's there?
</dd>,<dd><b>Rat King</b>: I am the rat king. [<i>opens eyes</i>] Why are you here?
</dd>,<dd><b>Kent</b>: I-I've got, like, this rad sword, and...I'm gonna fight you with it. [<i>runs to the rat king, jumps into his cloak and hits the rats</i>] Yes!
</dd>,<dd><b>Rat King</b>: [<i>fallen rats climb back into his cloak</i>] Who are you fighting me for? Your brother?
</dd>,<dd><b>Kent</b>: What?
</dd>,<dd><b>Rat King</b>: Instead, why don't you join me? I offer you cosmic power. You'll be a king and live the rest of your days as a god.
</dd>,<dd><b>Kent</b>: You're messing up the tree, and I totally live here! You're a bad guy!
</dd>,<dd><b>Rat King</b>: [<i>laughs</i>] Yeah. [<i>exclaims</i>]
</dd>,<dd><b>Kent</b>: [<i>flying through the air</i>] Don't do that! [<i>lands on a pile of rats</i>]
</dd>,<dd><b>Rat King</b>: How do you plan to defeat me?

</dd>,<dd>[<i>scene switches to Jake, <a href=""/wiki/Finn"" title=""Finn"">Finn</a> sets his arm on his head and they laugh, Shelby is watching them</i>]
</dd>,<dd><b>Shelby</b>: Having a brother around looks kind of fun. [<i>starts singing Little Brother</i>] Where are you? Little Brother? Are you happy? [<i>a transparent form of Kent shows on Shelby's tail</i>] Or do you feel weird? Have you changed a lot? Or not? Are you ever gonna come back here? I shouldn't have been so hasty. You were just a little baby. Or maybe you weren't. I'm not really sure how little brothers work. [<i>lays down and closes eyes, Kent's singing voice is heard</i>]
</dd>,<dd><b>Kent</b>: You were the first friend I ever had.
</dd>,<dd><b>Both</b>: No one can compare. Together we could probably fight a bear. [<i>Kent peeks out of the hole</i>] So if you're ever sad/lonely, don't be, 'cause I'll be [<i>Kent hops out of the hole and hugs Shelby</i>] right here next to you. 'Cause that's what big brothers are supposed to do. [<i>song ends, Kent shows Shelby his bag</i>]
</dd>,<dd><b>Shelby</b>: Whoa! [<i>scene changes to Shelby writing on paper with him narrating</i>] Kent proceeded his fantastic journey to me. It was all super good. But he had also partaken of the food of the underworld, and so he was compelled to return there by dewdrop law. That's what he said, at least. Maybe he was having second thoughts about infinite riches, true love, and eternal life. Or maybe he had just decided that fighting bad guys wasn't really his deal. [<i>scene shows the rat king, who is missing all of his teeth</i>] But I do know this—free from the rat king's cursed teeth, that spring, for the first time in many years, the willow tree was in bloom.

</dd>,<dd><b>Phlannel Boxingday</b>: So... read any good books lately?

</dd>,<dd><b>Phlannel Boxingday</b>: Greed Lards eat dosh for food, and 'cause we killed it, we get to keep it all. That's my job, Lemonhope.

Lemonhope Part 1/Transcript ,"<dd>[<i>Snoring is heard coming from a nest atop a rock jutting out of an expanse of water. A winged <a href=""/wiki/Lemonhope"" title=""Lemonhope"">Lemonhope</a> stands up in the nest, stretches, and yawns. He flies toward the sun, then dives down to the water and dips his hand in. He flies past three standalone gray doors and lands in front of a red one. He tries turning the knob, but suddenly hears knocking coming from the other side. He looks around the other side, but no one is there. The knocking continues and doorbells ring. Lemonhope wakes up to the sound of <a href=""/wiki/Princess_Bubblegum"" title=""Princess Bubblegum"">Princess Bubblegum</a> ringing a hand bell, signifying the resumption of class. <a href=""/wiki/Finn"" title=""Finn"">Finn</a> runs in, while Lemonhope, resting against a tree, groans and pulls at his face before reluctantly entering the school.

</dd>,<dd><b>Joshua</b>: Now let's get an egg in our shoe and beat it. [<i>shows them driving to Tree Trunks' house, they park their car and go to the door, Margaret knocks on it</i>]
</dd>,<dd><b>Tree Trunks</b>: [<i>opens the door</i>] Yes? Hello?
</dd>,<dd><b>Joshua</b>: [<i>fixes his tie</i>] Afternoon, Mrs. Tree Trunks. We're Joshua and Margaret of <i>Joshua and Margaret Investigations</i>. And this is [<i>pats Margaret's stomach</i>] our boy. We're responding to a wire about missing pies.
</dd>,<dd><b>Tree Trunks</b>: Oh, yes. A-a-a monster's been stealing my pies off of the windowsill.
</dd>,<dd><b>Joshua</b>: A monster, eh?
</dd>,<dd><b>Tree Trunks</b>: Oh, yes, you can see the monster [<i>Joshua and Margaret turn to the tracks</i>] tracks leading off into the forest.
</dd>,<dd><b>Joshua</b>: Well, those tracks are as phony as a three dollar bill.
</dd>,<dd><b>Tree Trunks</b>: The monster tracks are very real. [<i>shows <a href=""/wiki/Wyatt"" title=""Wyatt"">Wyatt</a> climbing into the window with snow shoes on his feet and holding a pie pan</i>] My husband told me so. [<i>Wyatt grunts, and falls in the window onto the floor</i>] Wyatt!
</dd>,<dd><b>Wyatt</b>: Aw, aw geez. You got me.
</dd>,<dd><b>Joshua</b>: [<i>him and Margaret step inside</i>] What's the big idea, Wyatt? Why'd you burgle your wife's pie?
</dd>,<dd><b>Wyatt</b>: Because it's amazing! Oh, I can't get enough of it.
</dd>,<dd><b>Tree Trunks</b>: You could just ask for seconds.
</dd>,<dd><b>Wyatt</b>: But I want thirds and fourths! I want to stop when I want to stop!
</dd>,<dd><b>Tree Trunks</b>: Oh, Wyatt.
</dd>,<dd><b>Wyatt</b>: [<i>crying</i>] Oh, it's the only good part of my day.
</dd>,<dd><b>Joshua</b>: Well, there you have it. The only monster here was this man's appetite for his wife's pie.
</dd>,<dd><b>Tree Trunks</b>: Oh, no. But the monster <i>is</i> real. He snuck up and rubbed my elbow while I was gardening. And <a href=""/wiki/Colonel_Candy_Corn"" title=""Colonel Candy Corn"">Leftenant Candy Corn</a> said it came in through the window and touched him on the chest. Oh! Oh, now I got myself all scared. W-won't you check around to make sure no one is out there?
</dd>,<dd><b>Joshua</b>: Of course. Probably nothing more than a peeper. [<i>they step out of the house</i>] Ha! These country yokels are all just superstitious. I bet you that old elephant sees a monster a day.
</dd>,<dd><b>Margaret</b>: Joshua, look! [<i>puts her paw in the track</i>] Something way larger than Wyatt made them. These tracks look real.
</dd>,<dd><b>Joshua</b>: Hot cram! A peeping monster! Oh, this town would surely put up a collection to nab this guy. Oh, too bad you're preggo. We got to pass. [<i>turns around and starts walking away</i>]
</dd>,<dd><b>Margaret</b>: Come on, Joshua! [<i>follows the tracks</i>]
</dd>,<dd><b>Joshua</b>: What? [<i>follows Margaret</i>]

</dd>,<dd><b>Joshua</b>: Gads! [<i>the monster screeches, Joshua goes and punches it</i>] Boom! [<i>the monster picks him up</i>] Do your worst, you masher.
</dd>,<dd><b>Margaret</b>: Joshua!

</dd>,<dd>[<i>Outside, the howling sound is louder. A paper-thing shadow demon slips through a tiny gap in the salt line.</i>]
</dd>,<dd><b>Shadow Demon 2</b>: Get my cup, Ariel! Please, dude!
</dd>,<dd><b>Ariel</b>: You get it! I need my DAT tapes.
</dd>,<dd><b>Shadow Demon 2</b>: I can't fit through that hole Ariel! Aaaah!
</dd>,<dd>[<i>Jermaine holds a button while Jake and Finn stand to either side of the front door. Finn has the <a href=""/wiki/Finn_Sword"" title=""Finn Sword"">Finn Sword</a>, Jake has the enormous sword from before.</i>]
</dd>,<dd>I'll shock him, and you guys ace his brains!
</dd>,<dd><b>Finn and Jake</b>: Got it!
</dd>,<dd><b>Jermaine</b>: [To Jake,] That sword's too unweildy, man.
</dd>,<dd><b>Jake</b>: But it'll look decent when I triple combo this bozo with this thing, right?
</dd>,<dd>[<i>Jake raises the sword over his head with great difficulty. He's bent backwards under its weight.</i>]
</dd>,<dd><b>Finn</b>: Like how?
</dd>,<dd><b>Jake</b>: Like this, bro! [Grunting]
</dd>,<dd>[<i>Jake spins around, tries to raise the sword and falls on his back in front of the door instead.</i>
</dd>,<dd><b>Jake</b>: Aah! Oof!
</dd>,<dd>[<i>The demon Ariel slides his head through the side of door.</i>]
</dd>,<dd><b>Ariel</b>: Boo, stupid!
</dd>,<dd>[<i>Finn swings his sword into the door, but Ariel has already flown inside. Jermaine pushes the button, and Finn screams as he's electrocuted.</i>]
</dd>,<dd>[<i>Cut to the ceiling, where Ariel stabs an arm down at Jermaine.</i>]
</dd>,<dd><b>Ariel</b>: Where's my DAT tapes?!
</dd>,<dd>[<i>Jermaine runs into the next room, and Ariel follows.</i>]
</dd>,<dd><b>Jermaine</b>: Epsilon, eudradies, epilindus...
</dd>,<dd>[<i>Jake tries to get up with the sword and falls again.</i>]
</dd>,<dd><b>Jake</b>: Oof! Why is this thing so dense?
</dd>,<dd>[<i>Cut to Jermaine running through the hall, Ariel close behind.</i>]
</dd>,<dd><b>Jermaine</b>: I got your tapes over here!
</dd>,<dd>[<i>Jermaine skids across the kitchen floor and under the table.</i>]
</dd>,<dd><b>Ariel</b>: Give me my ta--Oof! Aah!
</dd>,<dd>[<i>Jermaine kicks the table up and into Ariel, pinning the demon. Cut to Finn and Jake running in from the hall.</i>]
</dd>,<dd><b>Jake</b>: I got him! Hup!
</dd>,<dd>[<i>Jake jumps, makes himself larger and crashes down on the table, breaking the legs.</i>]
</dd>,<dd><b>Jake</b>: Sha-boom! Woah, watch it!
</dd>,<dd>[<i>Ariel hits at Jake with all four limbs. Cut to Jermaine running to the kitchen counter.</i>]
</dd>,<dd><b>Jake</b>: Cut his arms, Finn!
</dd>,<dd><b>Finn</b>: Okay!
</dd>,<dd>[<i>Jermaine kicks open a cabinet door and disappears into it. He rolls out of a different cabinet door under the sink with a vacuum strapped to his back. Finn and Jake are both shouting.</i>]
</dd>,<dd>[<i>Cut back to Finn and Jake fighting Ariel. The demon has gotten out from under the table and is standing, but his arms have been cut off. Jake holds on to one by its two fingers while it tries to escape, and Finn cuts the other in half on the other side of the room. Jake continues shouting. Jermaine enters with the vacuum, turns it on and points it at Ariel.</i>]
</dd>,<dd><b>Finn</b>: Woah!
</dd>,<dd>[<i>Ariel and his detached limbs are sucked into the vacuum.</i>]
</dd>,<dd><b>Jake</b>: Wha--?
</dd>,<dd><b>Ariel</b>: Aaaaah!
</dd>,<dd>[<i>Jermaine turns off the vacuum. Cut to outside, the rest of the demons still wait outside the salt line. Jermaine runs across the yard with the vacuum.</i>]
</dd>,<dd><b>Shadow Demon 2</b>: My cup, Jermaine!
</dd>,<dd>[<i>Jermaine drop-kicks the vacuum into the face of Shadow Demon 2.</i>]
</dd>,<dd><b>Shadow Demon 2</b>: Oof!
</dd>,<dd><b>Shadow Demon 3</b>: You're a pain, Jermaine!
</dd>,<dd>[<i>Jermaine pushes the salt of the gap back into a continuous line and stomps back across the lawn.</i>]
</dd>,<dd><b>Shadow Demons</b>: [Chanting] Jermaine the pain! Jermaine the pain!
</dd>,<dd>[<i>Scene changes to the foyer. Finn and Jake are both injured, but smiling.</i>]
</dd>,<dd><b>Jake</b>: [<i>Pumping his fists in the air,</i>] Awesome, dude! We won!
</dd>,<dd><b>Jermaine</b>: <i>I</i> didn't win! [<i>He stomps up to poke a finger in Jake's face.</i>] When do I win?! Special guys one and two win every day! Crackin' jokes, readin' foodie mags in your tree-town fun-house. Must be nice to be so special you can go off and find your own fancy ways! Meanwhile I gotta stay here and watch Dad's trashy booty 'cause I never stretched into the sky and farted on the wings of a falcon, I guess!
</dd>,<dd><b>Jake</b>: Dude, I never farted on the wing of a falcon. [Snorts]
</dd>,<dd>[<i>Jermaine punches Jake in the face. Jake falls, and Jermaine yells as he jumps on him.</i>]
</dd>,<dd><b>Finn</b>: Bros!
</dd>,<dd>[<i>Finn runs to follow the fight. Jake stands up and raises his hands in surrender.</i>]
</dd>,<dd><b>Jake</b>: Chill, Jermaine.
</dd>,<dd><b>Jermaine</b>: [<i>Uppercuts Jake on the chin.</i>] Think I don't want a cushy tree-house life?! [<i>Starts punching Jake repeatedly.</i>] I don't even get salt! <i>Saaalt!</i> [<i>Punching faster</i>] Bark! Bark! Bark! [<i>He pauses when his fist gets stuck in Jake's belly.</i>] Huh?
</dd>,<dd>[<i>Jake stretches to the other side of the room with his top half. As his bottom starts to follow Jermaine pulls his fist free and bites Jake's butt.</i>]
</dd>,<dd><b>Jake</b>: Yeowch!
</dd>,<dd>[<i>Jermaine hangs by his teeth from Jake's butt, growling. Jake's butt extends suddenly, punching Jermaine across the room. Jermaine grunts as he hits the bookshelf, then stands.</i>]
</dd>,<dd><b>Jermaine</b>: I'm sick of bein' Daddy's watchdog.
</dd>,<dd>[<i>A humanoid hand appears from off-screen to hand Jermaine a sneaker with wings. Jermaine grunts and throws it at Jake, who has coiled his long body and is hugging his butt. The sneaker starts flapping its wings halfway to Jake and flies away while Finn and Jake watch. Jermaine makes frustrated grumbling noises.</i>]
</dd>,<dd><b>Finn</b>: [To Jake,] This must've been building up for a while.
</dd>,<dd>[<i>Jermaine pulls the bottoms of his eyelids, roars, and throws the disembodied hand from before at Jake with a grunt.</i>]
</dd>,<dd><b>Jake</b>: Woah!
</dd>,<dd>[<i>Jake dodges with his upper body, grabbing his butt at the last moment to pull it out of the way as well. The hand lands in front of Finn at the front door and explodes. Finn protects his face from the small explosion with one arm. The hand grows huge where it landed and encloses Finn.</i>]
</dd>,<dd><b>Finn</b>: Wah!
</dd>,<dd>[<i>Finn's sword pokes out from the hand and cuts it in half, leaving fire in its wake. Finn jumps out from inside the hand. His sword remains on fire.</i>
</dd>,<dd><b>Finn</b>: Hand fire.
</dd>,<dd>[<i>Finn looks down, realizes his sword is on fire and yells. Cut back to the whole room, Jermaine is yelling at Jake, who is now slightly larger but still holding up his hands.</i>]
</dd>,<dd><b>Jermaine</b>: You got to be Dad's favorite! I got stuck with his mess!
</dd>,<dd><b>Jake</b>: Come on. Dad didn't have a favorite. He just liked my fart jokes.
</dd>,<dd>[<i>Jermaine picks up a ceramic bottle.</i>]
</dd>,<dd><b>Jermaine</b>: <i>I'm</i> the fart joke!
</dd>,<dd>[<i>Jermaine throws the bottle at Jake, who ducks. Cut to the front door, where the bottle lands in front of Finn and breaks. A dinosaur-like creature with birthday hats on its head and tail appears from the bottle in a puff of smoke.</i>]
</dd>,<dd><b>Creature</b>: Shazbaz! [<i>Looks around.</i>] Uh, no. Shazbaz!
</dd>,<dd>[<i>The creature vanishes in another puff of smoke. Cut to Jake and Jermaine. Jermaine punches Jake.</i>]
</dd>,<dd><b>Jake</b>: Ow. Dad loved us both. [<i>Jermaine punches him again.</i>] You could've left any time.
</dd>,<dd><b>Jermaine</b>: [<i>Punching Jake again,</i>] I know!
</dd>,<dd><b>Jake</b>: If you punch me again I'm gonna fart.
</dd>,<dd>[<i>Jermaine punches Jake again. Jake farts from the top of his head. Jermaine chuckles tiredly. Jake stretches his butt over next to Jermaine's head and farts again. Jermaine puts his hand to his face, still chuckling.</i>]
</dd>,<dd><b>Jermaine</b>: Oh man. I've really built my own cage.
</dd>,<dd>[<i>Cut to the entire room, half of which is on fire. Finn waves his arms, and Jake and Jermaine turn to look at him.</i>]
</dd>,<dd><b>Finn</b>: Guys, guys, guys!
</dd>,<dd>[<i>Cut to outside, we see the demons gathered around the salt circle while the entire building burns. The screen pans up, where the smoke takes the shape of a hand.</i>]
</dd>,<dd><b>Finn</b>: This whole place is burning down!
</dd>,<dd>[<i>Cut back to Finn.</i>]
</dd>,<dd><b>Finn</b>: So if you're done being angry bonkers, let's work together!
</dd>,<dd>[<i>Finn and Jake bump fists. They look to Jermaine, who is turned away with arms crossed.</i>]
</dd>,<dd><b>Finn</b>: Jermaine? You gonna leave me hanging, bro?
</dd>,<dd>[<i>Jermaine turns the other way and sighs, then turns his head towards Finn and Jake.</i>]
</dd>,<dd><b>Jermaine</b>: Let it burn.
</dd>,<dd><b>Jake</b>: Huh?!
</dd>,<dd><b>Finn</b>: [<i>Throws up his arms.</i>] But all of Dad's stuff!
</dd>,<dd>[<i>Close-up of Jermaine, the fire reflected in his eyes.</i>]
</dd>,<dd><b>Jermaine</b>: No... I think it's all right.
</dd>,<dd>[<i>Jermaine smiles and begins to cry. Fade to black.</i>]
</dd>,<dd>[<i>The next day, Finn is on one knee looking at the broken remains of the line of salt outside.</i>]
</dd>,<dd><b>Finn</b>: The salt line got broken. [<i>He runs a finger across a gap in the grass.</i>] Where'd all the d's go?
</dd>,<dd><b>Jake</b>: [<i>Lying back on the grass,</i>] Maybe with all their stuff gone they had no reason to stay.
</dd>,<dd>[<i>Cut to Jermaine, looking up at the sky. After a moment his watch starts to beep.</i>]
</dd>,<dd><b>Jermaine</b>: Oh, no! The tape!
</dd>,<dd>[<i>Jermaine runs back towards the house. He digs through the rubble until he unearths the basement entrance. He grunts as he tries to lift it.</i>]
</dd>,<dd><b>Jermaine</b>: Open...!
</dd>,<dd>[<i>Jake arrives, Finn on his back, and stretches to pull open the entrance. Jermaine falls back. All three stare into the basement as Bryce emerges, coughing, rolled-up poster in hand.</i>]
</dd>,<dd><b>Bryce</b>: I got my poster!
</dd>,<dd>[<i>Bryce coughs up Booboo Sousa, which has the face torn off of it. Jermaine goes to its side.</i>]
</dd>,<dd><b>Jermaine</b>: Booboo Sousa...
</dd>,<dd><b>Bryce</b>: I ate his stupid face off! It was sick.
</dd>,<dd><b>Jermaine</b>: Ugh. Do you even know what you sound like when you talk like that?
</dd>,<dd><b>Bryce</b>: I sound cool.
</dd>,<dd>[<i>Jermaine takes off his watch and throws it away.</i>]
</dd>,<dd><b>Jermaine</b>: If that's what you think.
</dd>,<dd><b>Bryce</b>: That's what I know.
</dd>,<dd>[<i>Cut to Finn, who watches as Bryce and Jermaine walk off together. Bryce squints at the sky as he walks.</i>]
</dd>,<dd><b>Bryce</b>: Dang. Has it always been so bright out here? Makes me wanna explode the sun and banish the Earth into darkness.
</dd>,<dd><b>Jermaine</b>: See? You're doing it again!
</dd>,<dd>[<i>Jake appears next to Finn wearing the bear costume, one ear still burning.</i>]

</dd>,<dd><b>Finn</b>: Huh? [<i>turns around, seeing lots of monsters climbing on the vehicle's windshield.</i>] Oh, my garf! What are they?!

</dd>,<dd><b>Jake</b>: Yeah, that's like the twenty-fifth time, right?
</dd>,<dd><b>Finn</b>: Yeah, obviously we'll have to re-clone him.
</dd>,<dd><b>Jake</b>: Totes.
</dd>,<dd><b>Princess Bubblegum</b>: Now hold up. This ground is perfectly solid. [<i>Princess Bubblegum jumps a few times.</i>] There's no loose gravel here.
</dd>,<dd><b>Jake</b>: So what? Clone him up, girl.
</dd>,<dd><b>Princess Bubblegum</b>: James is too reckless. I can't reward this kind of foolish behavior forever. It's time James takes his eternal nap.
</dd>,<dd><b>Finn</b>: But it's James!
</dd>,<dd><b>Jake</b>: Come P-Gum, don't be all cold-hearty!
</dd>,<dd><b>Princess Bubblegum</b>: I'm putting my foot down. There will be no more Jameses.
</dd>,<dd><b>Finn</b>: No...
</dd>,<dd><b>Princess Bubblegum</b>: I'm sorry. Look, I need you guys to go to James's apartment and box up his stuff.
</dd>,<dd><b>Jake</b>: [<i>later, in the Candy Kingdom</i>] And remember the time James saved PB from that contaminated cupcake?

</dd>,<dd><b>Finn</b>: James...
</dd>,<dd><b>James II</b>: Uh, I'm James number 2. The original James got all goopy in the desert.
</dd>,<dd><b>Jake</b>: Explain this biz, James II.
</dd>,<dd><b>James II</b>: Well... I was lonely! I knew Princess Bubs would make a new James if, you know, a James died a hero. So...
</dd>,<dd><b>Finn</b>: You faked your own death?
</dd>,<dd><b>James II</b>: Yeah! I just wanted a friend. [<i>James II grabs another James</i>] Someone who gets me!
</dd>,<dd><b>Finn</b>: James...
</dd>,<dd><b>James II</b>: Plus, each time I get kerplonked, I get another shiny medal, and why have two medals if you can have all the medals? Medals, medals, medals...
</dd>,<dd><b>Finn</b>: Dude, I've been to your funeral like twenty-five times.
</dd>,<dd><b>James II</b>: What? The medals make me happy. Plus, PLUS! It's a constant party here in [<i>James II turns around</i>] Jamestown!

</dd>,<dd><b>Finn</b>: We like you James but, you're on your own. We're gonna sit this one out.
</dd>,<dd>[<i>Finn and Jake go outside, sit on a bench while laughing.</i>]
</dd>,<dd><b>Finn</b>: This should be good.

</dd>,<dd><b>Finn</b>: Very enjoyable!
</dd>,<dd>[<i>Finn and Jake are sitting on the Candy Kingdom's walls and eating it while watching Princess Bubblegum and the banana guards</i>]
</dd>,<dd><b>Princess Bubblegum</b>: [<i>to the banana guards</i>] Okay, who's the Banana Guard Leader for this week?
</dd>,<dd><b>Banana Guard Leader</b>: I'm the leader.
</dd>,<dd><b>Princess Bubblegum</b>: This picture should help you find the Jameses.
</dd>,<dd><b>Banana Guard Leader</b>: Hey guys, it's the picture of one of the perpetrators. Take a good look.
</dd>,<dd><b>Banana Guards</b>: Ooooh!
</dd>,<dd><b>Princess Bubblegum</b>: There's twenty-five of them.
</dd>,<dd><b>Banana Guard Leader</b>: I need to see the other twenty-four pictures.
</dd>,<dd><b>Princess Bubblegum</b>: Nope, you only need that one.
</dd>,<dd><b>Banana Guard Leader</b>: What? How can one picture identify twenty-five perpetrators?
</dd>,<dd><b>Princess Bubblegum</b>: It's because they all look the same.
</dd>,<dd><b>Banana Guard Leader</b>: Oh okay, I see. There's twenty-five of them! They all look like this guy!
</dd>,<dd><b>Banana Guard I</b>: Huh, how can twenty-five guys look like one guy? You mean they're viginti-quintuplets?
</dd>,<dd><b>Banana Guard Leader</b>: You mean they're viginti-quintuplets?
</dd>,<dd><b>Princess Bubblegum</b>: No! They're clones.
</dd>,<dd><b>Banana Guard Leader</b>: What are clones?
</dd>,<dd><b>Princess Bubblegum</b>: [<i>sighs then speaks very fast</i>] A group of organisms or cells produced asexually from one ancestor or stock, to which they are genetically identical.
</dd>,<dd><b>Banana Guard II</b>: How did that happen?
</dd>,<dd><b>Princess Bubblegum</b>: It's a long story.
</dd>,<dd><b>Banana Guard Leader</b>: I love long stories.
</dd>,<dd><b>Princess Bubblegum</b>: Aaah! There's no time!
</dd>,<dd><b>Banana Guard Leader</b>: And they're not brothers?
</dd>,<dd><b>Princess Bubblegum</b>: No! They're not brothers, they're clones!
</dd>,<dd>[<i>Finn and Jake are laughing, Princess Bubblegum hears them</i>]
</dd>,<dd><b>Princess Bubblegum</b>: [<i>shouting</i>] Hey! Get down here and help me! [<i>Finn and Jake indicate to her to go see them and she sighs</i>] Viginti-quintuplets! I'm telling you...
</dd>,<dd><b>Princess Bubblegum</b>: What are you doing? Why aren't you helping?
</dd>,<dd><b>Jake</b>: Come on PBs, just sit here with us for five minutes.
</dd>,<dd><b>Princess Bubblegum</b>: Why?
</dd>,<dd><b>Jake</b>: Come on! Five minutes!
</dd>,<dd>[<i>Princess Bubblegum sits down and sighs. Jake gives her a brick of the wall to eat</i>]
</dd>,<dd><b>Princess Bubblegum</b>: Maybe just a brick.
</dd>,<dd><b>Banana Guard Leader</b>: [<i>to one of the Jameses who's walking in front of them</i>] Hey you, stop!
</dd>,<dd><b>Clone James I</b>: Yeah?
</dd>,<dd><b>Banana Guard Leader</b>: Have you seen this guy?
</dd>,<dd><b>Clone James I</b>: Hmm...
</dd>,<dd><b>Princess Bubblegum</b>: [<i>cluckles</i>] I have to admit, it's fun to watch.
</dd>,<dd><b>Banana Guard Leader</b>: [<i>when seeing two other Jameses</i>] You two stop too! [<i>to the first James</i>] Show them the picture!
</dd>,<dd><b>Clone James I</b>: Alright.
</dd>,<dd><b>Banana Guard Leader</b>: Have you guys seen this guy?
</dd>,<dd><b>Clone James II&amp;III</b>: Hmm...
</dd>,<dd>[<i>Three other Jameses come and look at the picture with the others. Princess Bubblegum, Finn and Jake laugh at them while all the left Jameses come and look at the picture.</i>]

</dd>,<dd><b>Banana Guard Leader</b>: Hmm... Hmm... [<i>to Clone James I</i>] What's your name?
</dd>,<dd><b>Clone James I</b>: James.
</dd>,<dd><b>Banana Guard Leader</b>: [<i>pointing to a random James with their finger</i>] What's your name?
</dd>,<dd><b>Clone James IV</b>: James.
</dd>,<dd><b>Clone James V</b>: [<i>when the Banana guard leader points to him</i>] James.
</dd>,<dd><b>Clone James VI</b>: [<i>when the Banana guard leader points to him</i>] James.
</dd>,<dd><b>Banana Guard Leader</b>: You're all named James. Is it because you guys look alike?
</dd>,<dd><b>Clone James VI</b>: I guess so.
</dd>,<dd><b>Banana Guard Leader</b>: Y'know, I was telling this to the guys... If, if we look alike, we should have the same name. It would just make it a little easier. Life, that is. It would make our life a little easier. [<i>crying</i>] Aah... Give me a second... [<i>wipes the tear</i>] Same name... Look alike... You really look alike... Brothers! You're all brothers?
</dd>,<dd><b>Clone James VI</b>: No... I don't think so.
</dd>,<dd><b>Banana Guard Leader</b>: [<i>counting the Jameses</i>] One, two, three, four, five, six, seven-
</dd>,<dd><b>Clone James VI</b>: Twenty-five. If you're counting how many of us look alike, there's twenty-five.
</dd>,<dd><b>Banana Guard Leader</b>: Hmm... Twenty-five... Not brothers... [<i>They remember Princess Bubblegum saying “No, they're not brothers, they're clones!” to them.</i>] [<i>to the other banana guards</i>] I think these are the twenty-five that are not brothers. [<i>shouting</i>] Perpetrators! Get to them! [<i>The banana guards start running after the Jameses and Princess Bubblegum, Finn and Jake laugh again.</i>]
</dd>,<dd><b>Banana Guard II</b>: [<i>Four Jameses hide in a glove shop from four banana guards.</i>] Where they'd go?
</dd>,<dd><b>The four Banana Guards</b>: [<i>The four Jameses leave the shop wearing gloves but the gloves fall on the ground</i>] It's them!
</dd>,<dd><b>The four Jameses</b>: Whoop whoop!
</dd>,<dd>[<i>The Banana Guards start chasing the Jameses again</i>]
</dd>,<dd>[<i>Princess Bubblegum, Finn and Jake are sitting on top of a building and are watching the Jameses building a trap for the Banana Guards. The Banana Guards arrive and are about to enter the trap but it falls apart in front of them. They finally surround the Jameses</i>]

</dd>,<dd><b>Jameses</b>: Aww!
</dd>,<dd><b>Princess Bubblegum</b>: [<i>She, Finn and Jake walk to the Jameses</i>]Okay, fun's over. You're not heroes! [<i>rips off James II's medals</i>] You don't deserve these medals.

</dd>,<dd><b>James II</b>: Man, we do deserve them medals. It's not like she can give them to someone else. I wrote my name on all of them.
</dd>,<dd><b>Clone James</b>: Yeah, so did I. [<i>Princess Bubblegum screams</i>]
</dd>,<dd><b>James II</b>: Princess!
</dd>,<dd><b>Princess Bubblegum</b>: [<i>a goo monster is walking toward her, and she gasps</i>] The original James?

</dd>,<dd><b><a href=""/wiki/BMO"" title=""BMO"">BMO</a></b>: [<i>Continues crying.</i>]
</dd>,<dd><b>Jake</b>: I think he broke his egg.
</dd>,<dd><b>Finn</b>: Hey, it's okay BMO. Look, Jake and I will make you a funny face. [<i>As Finn holds Jake, Finn stretches his mouth and he and Jake make noises.</i>]
</dd>,<dd><b>BMO</b>: [<i>Stares at the two but begins to cry again. Finn and Jake sit down looking defeated.</i>]
</dd>,<dd><b>Jake</b>: Hey, BMO, this will cheer ya up! [<i>He does a handstand and stretches his buttcheeks to enclose Finn's face.</i>]
</dd>,<dd><b>Finn</b>: [<i>Muffled</i>] What the?! [<i>Muffled screaming</i>]
</dd>,<dd><b>BMO</b>: [<i>Continues crying.</i>]
</dd>,<dd>[<i>After a few seconds of this, Jake releases Finn and Finn breathes grasps for air.</i>]
</dd>,<dd><b>Jake</b>: Well, I'm outta ideas. [<i>Finn glares</i>] What?
</dd>,<dd>[<i>Whinnying is heard and a horse balancing on a beach ball arrives. They all stand up to watch him.</i>]
</dd>,<dd><b><a href=""/wiki/James_Baxter"" title=""James Baxter"">James Baxter</a></b>: [<i>Whinnies</i>] James Baxter! James... Baxter!
</dd>,<dd><b>BMO</b>: [<i>Begins to laugh</i>]
</dd>,<dd><b>Jake</b>: Oh, man, James Baxter is so good, man. He always knows just what to say to cheer a guy up!
</dd>,<dd><b>Finn</b>: Yeah, man.
</dd>,<dd>[<i>Scene shifts to BMO and James Baxter, BMO is clapping and running after the horse as it continues to balance on the ball and say its name.</i>]
</dd>,<dd><b>Jake</b>: So good!
</dd>,<dd><b>Finn</b>: Man, we should do it to! Do his thing and spread the good will!
</dd>,<dd><b>Jake</b>: Yeah, man, I wanna be like James Baxter, always rollin' in on a beach ball, saying his name in a horse voice, making people smile. [<i>sighs</i>] Let's do it!
</dd>,<dd><b>Finn</b>: [<i>Laughs</i>] Yeah!
</dd>,<dd>[<i>The scene is a funeral, four persons stand solemnly. Upon hearing noises they look up and turn towards Finn and Jake, who are in the bushes saying their names in a horse-like voices.</i>]
</dd>,<dd><b>Finn</b>: [<i>Neighs</i>] Finn the Human!
</dd>,<dd><b>Jake</b>: [<i>Neighs</i>] Jake!
</dd>,<dd><b>Finn</b>: [<i>Neighs</i>] Finn!
</dd>,<dd><b>Jake</b>: [<i>Neighs</i>] Jake!
</dd>,<dd>[<i>The attendees are shocked and can only look at the two with mouths agape.</i>]
</dd>,<dd><b>Jake</b>: [<i>Whispering</i>] Sheesh, tough crowd.
</dd>,<dd><b>Finn</b>: [<i>Whispering</i>] I think we should find an easier person to cheer up. It was a mistake to visit a funeral.
</dd>,<dd><b>Jake</b>: [<i>Nods</i>]
</dd>,<dd>[<i>Finn and Jake jump out of the bushes and run down a hill, away from the proceedings. As the attendees watch they quickly turn back around to see the coffin shake around.</i>]
</dd>,<dd>[<i>The next scene is the neighborhood area of the Candy Kingdom. A green Lollipop Girl is humming a tune and holding an ice cream cone, but the ice cream drops from the cone and she begins to cry.</i>] [<i>Finn and Jake arrive once again saying their names in horse-like voice, only this time jumping up and down. The girl sees them and stops crying but is shocked at their behavior and becomes scared to a point that she loudly screams and runs away from them.]</i>
</dd>,<dd><b>Finn &amp; Jake</b>: [<i>Continue making loud noises and running after the girl.</i>]
</dd>,<dd><b>Green Lollipop Girl</b>: [<i>Heads toward an alleyway in tears. She realizes she's trapped.</i>]
</dd>,<dd><b>Finn &amp; Jake</b>: [<i>Stand in the alley's entrance and continue to make noises.</i>]
</dd>,<dd><b>Green Lollipop Girl</b>: Eh, what do you want?! Please, I'm just a very sad girl!
</dd>,<dd><b>Finn &amp; Jake</b>: [<i>Don't answer and instead continue to make loud noises. This causes the girl to scream again, so loudly that both cover their ears and back out of the alley.</i>]
</dd>,<dd>[<i>Proceeding scene, Finn and Jake are sitting on a hill, Finn sighs. They are looking down the hill to see James Baxter surrounded by <a href=""/wiki/Candy_Kid"" title=""Candy Kid"">Candy Kid</a> as they cheer and laugh at his performance.</i>]
</dd>,<dd><b>Finn</b>: That is so perfect!
</dd>,<dd><b>Jake</b>: Yeah, man, so unique!
</dd>,<dd><b>James Baxter</b>: James Baxter! James Baxter!
</dd>,<dd><b>Finn</b>: Man, what's he doing that we're not? We just gotta figure <i>that</i> out.
</dd>,<dd><b>Jake</b>: No, it's like, he's shredding on a guitar and learning how to shred isn't just copying the exact notes as someone else's solo. You need to learn how to do your <i>own</i> solo. [<i>Imitates guitar riff.</i>]
</dd>,<dd>[<i>Back at the Tree Fort, noises are heard. Inside Jake and Finn are making noises, contorting themselves and dancing around. BMO watches them.</i>]
</dd>,<dd><b>BMO</b>: Why am I recording?
</dd>,<dd><b>Finn</b>: You're documenting our creative flow in case we make a breakthrough.
</dd>,<dd><b>Jake</b>: Dude, I think we <i>do</i> got something.
</dd>,<dd><b>Finn</b>: Let's check the video.
</dd>,<dd>[<i>The three are in the bathroom climbing into the tub with BMO.</i>]
</dd>,<dd><b>BMO</b>: [<i>Laughs</i>] Bathtub, Bathtub!
</dd>,<dd>[<i>With clipboards in hand, Finn and Jake sit down to face BMO.</i>]
</dd>,<dd><b>Jake</b>: Alright, BMO, play the video.
</dd>,<dd><b>BMO</b>: [<i>Plays back the recording, then stops it.</i>] Who's gonna scrub me?
</dd>,<dd><b>Jake</b>: I'll scrub, [<i>to Finn</i>] you take notes.
</dd>,<dd><b>BMO</b>: [<i>Starts playing the recording again.</i>]
</dd>,<dd><b>Finn</b>: Yeah, right there, speed it up.
</dd>,<dd><b>Jake</b>: [<i>Adjust BMO's settings to speed up the video.</i>]
</dd>,<dd><b>Finn</b>: Slow it down.
</dd>,<dd><b>Jake</b>: [<i>Adjust BMO's settings to slow down the video.</i>]
</dd>,<dd><b>Finn</b>: [<i>Takes notes and laughs.</i>]
</dd>,<dd><b>Jake</b>: [<i>Laughs too.</i>]
</dd>,<dd><b>BMO</b>: Yeah, that sounds makes me feel happy!
</dd>,<dd><b>Finn</b>: Good, good, happy is what we want.
</dd>,<dd><b>Jake</b>: BMO, zoom in on my mouth [<i>laughs causing BMO to laugh too.</i>]
</dd>,<dd><b>Finn</b>: Yeah, it's good, [<i>stands up</i>] but if we want to be ""James Baxter"" good, we gotta to go deeper.
</dd>,<dd>[<i>The scene shifts to a wooded area. Then shows BMO, Jake, and Finn with clipboard, walking in a clearing, they continue till they are seen walking up a tall hill with white trees, by then the sun is setting. They continue till they are inside the entrance way.</i>]

</dd>,<dd><b>Receptor</b>: Just think happy thoughts and follow the beat of your heart.
</dd>,<dd>[<i>Finn closes his eyes, puts his hand to his chest and walks in. He is followed by Jake and BMO, a thumping noise is heard. Finn suddenly stops and they bump into one another.</i>]
</dd>,<dd><b>Finn</b>: Hold up.... This way... [<i>they continue, walking along the paths. Finn gasp as they arrive at the room they are looking for.</i>]
</dd>,<dd>[<i>The room is full of amplifiers and other electronic equipment.</i>]
</dd>,<dd><b>Jake</b>: [<i>Gasp</i>] Look at this tricked out studio! Half stacks! Full stacks! Oooh, distortion pedals!
</dd>,<dd><b>BMO</b>: [<i>Plays recording with close up of Jake's part, Finn plugs it to the amplifiers. The sound resonates throughout the room.</i>]
</dd>,<dd><b>Jake</b>: These sounds make feel-good, right here. [<i>puts hand over his heart area</i>]
</dd>,<dd><b>Finn</b>: Right here. [<i>Finn does the same gesture.</i>] Good!
</dd>,<dd><b>BMO</b>: I feel it here, [<i>Circles hands all over front.</i>] good here!

</dd>,<dd>[<i>The scene afterward is all three sitting down, Jake in a pile of equipment, BMO pushing buttons on one of them, and Finn spinning on a straw inside a drink cup. He stops and looks to them.</i>]
</dd>,<dd><b>Finn</b>: Check our data?
</dd>,<dd>[<i>They all stand and look to a large blackboard with circuit schematics, both Finn and Jake are holding a clipboards, with Finn also holding a pencil.</i>]
</dd>,<dd><b>Finn</b>: Maybe it should be higher?
</dd>,<dd><b>Jake</b>: Yeah, maybe, maybe it could be lower, I don't know.
</dd>,<dd><b>Finn</b>: [<i>Points with a pencil</i>] Let's both agree that <i>that</i> sound belongs <i>there</i>. [<i>Steps back as Jake walks up.</i>]
</dd>,<dd><b>Jake</b>: See that sound? I drew that sound connected to two other sounds. [<i>Steps back and stands next to Finn.</i>]
</dd>,<dd><b>Finn</b>: Hmm, something's missing. [<i>He stares at the board, on which are pictures of James Baxter on his ball. The camera zooms in on the ball.</i>]
</dd>,<dd><b>Finn &amp; Jake</b>: [<i>Turn to one another and gasp loudly.</i>]
</dd>,<dd><b>Jake</b>: That's it, the missing thing in our thing!
</dd>,<dd><b>Finn</b>: Yeah, James Baxter don't just got his catch phrase, he has his beach ball bizz!
</dd>,<dd><b>Jake</b>: So we gotta create feel good body actions to go <i>with</i> our feel good sound!
</dd>,<dd><b>Finn</b>: We just crushed it, homie.
</dd>,<dd><b>Jake</b>: [<i>Puts down clipboard</i>] Dude, seriously, I think our thing is gonna change the world. When people experience it, it's going to make them <i>so</i> happy!
</dd>,<dd><b>Finn</b>: [<i>Also puts down clipboard</i>] You're building it up too much. [<i>yawns</i>] Let's just do it.
</dd>,<dd><b>Jake</b>: [<i>Yawns</i>] Yeah, man, yeah.

</dd>,<dd>[<i>The next morning at the Candy Kingdom. Finn and Jake are walking around the neighborhood, they spot the Green Lollipop Girl who has returned to the spot where her ice cream fell only this time she dropped her drink cup. Her eyes widen as she is upset and nearing tears.</i>]
</dd>,<dd><b>Jake</b>: [<i>Points</i>] Hey, there's the sad girl.  [<i>Finn and Jake walk up and she turns to face them.</i>]
</dd>,<dd><b>Green Lollipop Girl</b>: Wha—[<i>screams</i>].
</dd>,<dd><b>Jake</b>: No no no, wait a sec! Reserve judgement until you've see the freshed-up version of our thing.
</dd>,<dd><b>Finn &amp; Jake</b>: [<i>Face each other and nod. They start their act: they criss-cross each other at the shoulder, Finn picks up Jake and guides him past both cheeks, Jake morphs into a trumpet and starts making imitating the sound of one.

</dd>,<dd><b>Jake</b>: What's wrong?
</dd>,<dd><b>Grass Person</b>: We're bummed.
</dd>,<dd>[<i>Jake morphs into a trumpet and Finn picks him up as they do their performance. This causes the Grass People to laugh.</i>] [<i>Next scene, a male ghost is floating down a train's track with a bundle stick, he sighs heavily by going, ""Boo, boo."" Suddenly Finn and Jake arrive.

</dd>,<dd><b>Jake</b>: Let's just do the thing.
</dd>,<dd><b>Finn</b>: Right, okay! [<i>They start with the trumpet act and this causes the attendees to laugh. Suddenly the coffin shakes as Finn and Jake preform their balancing act.

</dd>,<dd><b>Jake</b>: [<i>Pops out of the only flower present</i>] Sorry, I act like a little kitty cat!
</dd>,<dd>[<i>Finn leaps up and Jake holds him as he stretches to the height of the angry spirit. When they reach its head they are spitted on and fall back to the ground covered in liquid.</i>]
</dd>,<dd><b>Finn</b>: Whoa, [<i>licks arm</i>] it's milk!
</dd>,<dd><b>Ghost</b>: [<i>It attacks by taking out a large chunk of land by dragging its hand, Finn and Jake dodge. With Finn having to dodge again into Jake's arms.</i>] [<i>The ghost attempts another attack by body crushing them, it misses as they run away.</i>] WHY?!! [<i>It yells.</i>]

</dd>,<dd><b>Finn</b>: What?
</dd>,<dd><b>Jake</b>: It's just that there are a lot of dead people there, we might get separated. I'll be the one going [<i>rhythmic clap.</i>]
</dd>,<dd><b>Ghost</b>: [<i>It goes to attack them with another punch but stops right above them as the whinnying of a horse is heard. It looks behind it to see a horse standing on a hill, James Baxter.</i>]
</dd>,<dd><b>James Baxter</b>: [<i>Runs down the hill and arrives to the scene balancing on his ball and saying his name.</i>] James Baxter!... James Baxter! [<i>This causes the ghost to go from angry to happy, it laughs at the sight.</i>]
</dd>,<dd><b>Ghost</b>: Holy cow! [<i>Its fist softens and it instead grabs Finn and Jake and pulls them out of the hole and places them on the ground.</i>] Hey, man, this guy really knows how to cheer a guy up!

</dd>,<dd><b>Finn</b>: So... are you ready to come home?
</dd>,<dd><b>Jake</b>: Nah, I think I was just gonna keep being a brick for a while.
</dd>,<dd><b>Finn</b>: Umm... what are you doing again?
</dd>,<dd><b>Jake</b>: Finn, ever since I was little, I wanted to see what it's like to be a brick in a brick shack when the brick shack falls down. And this shack is gonna fall down. Just look at it. Like sandcastles in the sun, baby. [<i>laughs</i>] You're too young; you wouldn't understand.
</dd>,<dd><b>Finn</b>: [<i>laughs</i>] You're right. I don't understand. But I'm cool with your mystical journey or whatever. I'm gonna leave this walkie-talkie so we can stay in touch. Just in case.
</dd>,<dd><b>Jake</b>: What? No, man, bricks don't stay in touch!
</dd>,<dd><b>Finn</b>: Dude, BMO is, like, really worried about you.
</dd>,<dd><b>Jake</b>: Aww. You tell that little goofball I said hi.
</dd>,<dd><b>Finn</b>: I will. [<i>looks at sun</i>] Well, I guess I should head back.
</dd>,<dd><b>Jake</b>: Oh. Really? So soon?
</dd>,<dd><b>Finn</b>: Yeah, well, it took me, like, half a day to get here. Besides, you're just a brick, right?
</dd>,<dd><b>Jake</b>: [<i>laughs</i>] Yeah.
</dd>,<dd><b>Finn</b>: [<i>leaving</i>] Alright, see ya, Jake!
</dd>,<dd><b>Jake</b>: Bye! Okay, back to being a brick. [<i>beat</i>] I'm so bored.
</dd>,<dd>[<i>Finn heads back the way he came. The sun sets.</i>]
</dd>,<dd><b>Jake</b>: [<i>blows raspberry</i>] Ooh, I'm starting to get a little tippy in my teacups.
</dd>,<dd>[<i>A nearby bush rustles, and out hops a rabbit.</i>]
</dd>,<dd><b>Jake</b>: [<i>quietly</i>] A bunny!
</dd>,<dd>[<i>The rabbit hops over to a plant and starts digging it out.</i>]
</dd>,<dd><b>Jake</b>: Looks like our long-eared friend is on to something. Bunnies love to dig. He's making a supreme effort, and I think I can guess why.
</dd>,<dd>[<i>The bunny digs the plant out enough to reveal it is a carrot.</i>]
</dd>,<dd><b>Jake</b>: That's right. A carrot, grown out here free and wild, probably the result of a seed pooped out by a passing bird.
</dd>,<dd>[<i>The rabbit's attention is diverted by rustling in a bush.</i>]
</dd>,<dd><b>Jake</b>: But what's this? A mysterious rustling in the bush. Could mean trouble. Mr. Bunny seems to think so. His sensitive whiskers quiver at the hint of imminent danger.
</dd>,<dd>[<i>The screen splits to show BMO bringing Finn a bowl of popcorn. They sit on the couch and listen to Jake's commentary through the walkie-talkie.</i>]
</dd>,<dd><b>Jake</b>: Unfortunately for Mr. Bunny, this is what nature is all about. It's a male deer. Not a threat to Mr. Bunny in the predatory sense, but still above him in the food chain. Mr. Bunny, wishing to avoid an encounter, hops away to safety.
</dd>,<dd>[<i>The deer eats the carrot.</i>]
</dd>,<dd><b>Jake</b>: Wow, deers are jerks.
</dd>,<dd><b>Finn</b>: Hey, man. You know I can hear everything you say, right?
</dd>,<dd><b>Jake</b>: What?! Arrrrrgh! No! I had no idea.
</dd>,<dd><b>Finn</b>: Yeah, but you saw me leave the walkie-talkie, and I left it on. You know that, right?

</dd>,<dd><b>Finn</b>: Need anything? A soda?
</dd>,<dd><b>Jake</b>: No.
</dd>,<dd><b>Finn</b>: So what's Mr. Bunny doing now?
</dd>,<dd><b>Jake</b>: It's not about the bunny! The bunny is incidental to the brick experiment.
</dd>,<dd><b>Finn</b>: Oh. Sorry, man.
</dd>,<dd><b>Jake</b>: Forget about the bunny.
</dd>,<dd><b>Finn</b>: Sorry, man.
</dd>,<dd><b>BMO</b>: Sorry, Jake.
</dd>,<dd><b>Finn</b>: Look, we'll, uh, we'll leave you alone. [<i>pushes in walkie-talkie antenna</i>]
</dd>,<dd>[<i>The screen returns to showing only Jake's side.</i>]
</dd>,<dd><b>Jake</b>: Finn? Are you still there? Finn? BMO?
</dd>,<dd>[<i>The rabbit drops what remains of the carrot and returns to its home in the roots of a tree.</i>]
</dd>,<dd><b>Jake</b>: Mr. Bunny retreats to its warren. Its homemade comfort is some consolation to help pass the hungry night. Twilight falls on the peaceful forest, a twilight unaware of the struggles it both soothes and conceals. The crickets begin to stir, rehearsing their musical rhapsodies. In the distance, flashes of heat lightning illuminate a purple summer sky. Even angry deer, at last, must come to rest. And so it is with our erstwhile antagonist, who has disappeared into a stand of trees, perhaps to dream of tomorrow's pointless battles.
</dd>,<dd>[<i>Jake yawns and closes his eyes. He is awoken by a raging thunderstorm.</i>]
</dd>,<dd><b>Jake</b>: Oh, my <a href=""/wiki/Grob_Gob_Glob_Grod"" title=""Grob Gob Glob Grod"">Gob</a>, it's a crazy storm! This might be it! This weather might knock the whole thing down! [<i>laughs, then stops and looks at the rabbit</i>]
</dd>,<dd>[<i>The screen splits again, showing Finn with <a href=""/wiki/Starchie"" title=""Starchie"" class=""mw-redirect"">Starchie</a>, who is broadcasting Jake's voice.</i>]
</dd>,<dd><b>Jake</b>: If a definition of bravery exists, then this must be it. A lone bunny, facing off against the elements, ineffectually pushing around some twigs with his pink bunny nose, a symbolic gesture, perhaps, but sometimes that's all we have. The wind is beginning to pick up. It's becoming clear that Mother Nature has not just knocked on the door, she has come in, sat down, and poured herself a drink. Mr. Bunny has no friends, no family, no loved ones of any kind. The wind is really picking up now. Small puddles gathering around the entrance to Mr. Bunny's cozy home are beginning to grow in size and connect with one another. It won't be long now. But what's this?! Looks like this unflagging little hero of a bunny will have some help, though! A family of friendly beavers appears to have taken up the cause.
</dd>,<dd>[<i>The rabbit leaves its home, and two beavers shield it from the rain with their tails. Finn writes ""Boost frequency?"" on a piece of paper and shows it to Starchie, who gives him a thumbs up. Finn crumbles up the paper and throws it toward the wastebasket, missing again. Starchie brings over three more microphones and positions them above the walkie-talkie.</i>]
</dd>,<dd><b>Jake</b>: Often called nature's architects, these intrepid mammals are sparing no effort to shore up the endangered burrow. Here's an unusual sight. It's a <a href=""/wiki/Sea_Lards"" title=""Sea Lards"">Sea Lard</a>! You'd expect to see a few <a href=""/wiki/Woobeewoo_Villagers"" title=""Woobeewoo Villagers"">mudscamps</a> out in weather like this, but here we have a rare treat indeed. This little beauty is pretty far outside of her natural habitat, but I've heard it said by wise old salts schooled in ancient maritime lore that storms will sometimes blow them off course to a remarkable degree. Looks like we've got some pretty good evidence tonight. Yes, sir, sometimes those old sailors know what they're talking about. It's a triumph of experience versus the secondhand verities of musty academic tomes. This feisty Sea Lard is pitchin' right in to save the rabbit hole, belying its slothful reputation. She uses her prodigious swiveling behind to increase the size of the hole, while the beavers continue to reinforce the sides with straw and stick. Times like these, supposed cruelty and indifference of the natural world, all too often its most salient feature, pale before the nobler instincts of even our most humble kin.
</dd>,<dd>[<i>Finn and Starchie fall asleep. At dawn, Jake continues his commentary with bags under his eyes.</i>]
</dd>,<dd><b>Jake</b>: In the morning light, few signs remain of the summer storm that battered this idyllic glen. The beavers are finished with their work and are heading home. The Sea Lard looks like she's gonna wander the woods for a while. Maybe she'll find her way back to the ocean and write a novel about her experiences. Mr. Bunny is exhausted but can rest easy knowing that his home is secure. But alas, the bunny's rest is short-lived. The deer is back.
</dd>,<dd>[<i>Finn and Starchie perk up.</i>]
</dd>,<dd><b>Jake</b>: The deer, perhaps confused by the antler-like appearance of Mr. Bunny's protective dam, is now testing the situation.
</dd>,<dd>[<i>The deer pushes some twigs with its antlers.</i>]
</dd>,<dd><b>Jake</b>: The bunny is unsure of where this is going.
</dd>,<dd>[<i>The deer suddenly stomps on the dam. The rabbit flees.</i>]
</dd>,<dd><b>Jake</b>: And with a single smash from the deer's powerful front hooves, the bunny's home is under attack! Mr. Bunny has hopped to safety and can only watch as the deer continues its relentless rampage on the only home he knows. A couple more mighty smashes, and the dam—the dam has been breached! Water is now flooding in! The deer continues its attack! This deer's misplaced rage, combined with its size and weight, is more than enough to bring down the weakened walls, which are now starting to give, aided by the unforgiving weigh from the tree above. Even Mr. Deer, in his blind fury, seems to sense what's about to happen as he steps to one side!
</dd>,<dd>[<i>A huge crash is heard through the radio.</i>]
</dd>,<dd><b>Jake</b>: It's over. The warren has been destroyed.
</dd>,<dd>[<i>Starchie offers Finn a tissue.</i>]
</dd>,<dd><b>Jake</b>: An injustice of astronomical levels. Words fail me.
</dd>,<dd>[<i>The rabbit returns to the fallen tree.</i>]
</dd>,<dd><b>Jake</b>: Actually, he doesn't seem that upset.
</dd>,<dd>[<i>The rabbit enters a hole in the hollow trunk.</i>]
</dd>,<dd><b>Jake</b>: He's on his feet, checking out his new surroundings—even the deer is impressed! As if confused by the events, he performs a comical double-take and retreats into the forest. Ladies and gentlemen, this bunny is indomitable!
</dd>,<dd>[<i>Everyone listening celebrates.</i>]
</dd>,<dd><b>Jake</b>: [<i>laughs</i>] This bunny has the right attitude. Who cares about being a brick in a wall of a fallen-down shack? There's something bigger than that, and the bunny has answers. [<i>stretches out of wall</i>] Teach me, Mr. B!
</dd>,<dd>[<i>The shack collapses.</i>]
</dd>,<dd><b>Jake</b>: Aw.
</dd>,<dd><b>Finn</b>: Jake? Jake? You there, buddy? Over.

</dd>,<dd>[<i>A bird woman walks in with a ladder</i>]
</dd>,<dd><b>Cosmic Owl</b>: Who's that? (pause) She's so beautiful! Buttfeathers!
</dd>,<dd><b>Finn</b>: Huh! The cosmic owl? Does that mean this dream is important? Is this a prophetic dream? And is this stuff all symbolic or literal?
</dd>,<dd><b>Cosmic Owl</b>: Huh? Sorry, but...
</dd>,<dd><b>Finn</b>: What does it all mean, boy?
</dd>,<dd><b>Cosmic Owl</b>: Dang she's gone...wait, what are you asking me? I can't tell you that? Hoo!

</dd>,<dd><b>Jake</b>: Pull 'im up, pull 'im up!
</dd>,<dd>[<i>BMO pulls Shelby out of Finn's mouth.</i>]
</dd>,<dd><b>Finn</b>: I think I just had a prophetic dream. Cosmic Owl was in it, he was acting all choco-loco.
</dd>,<dd><b>Jake</b>: Finn, you gotta go back to sleep!
</dd>,<dd><b>Finn</b>: Huh?
</dd>,<dd><b>Jake</b>: Cosmic owl dreams are important always! You gotta Go Back and find them again.
</dd>,<dd><b>Finn</b>: Yeah but last time I chased a cosmic owl dream I got dumped.

</dd>,<dd><b>Finn</b>: What?
</dd>,<dd><b>Jake</b>: (shushes Finn)
</dd>,<dd><b>Finn</b>: (snoring)

</dd>,<dd><b>Prismo</b>: What! Who's?
</dd>,<dd><b>Cosmic Owl</b>: Finn the human.
</dd>,<dd><b>Prismo</b>: What? Who's that! Oh, wait, I know that guy. Look, I don't think you're put in charge of prophetic dreams so you could meet ladies.
</dd>,<dd><b>Cosmic Owl</b>: ""Hoo"" cares. I'm in love!
</dd>,<dd><b>Prismo</b>: Oh, what am I even worried about. How will you ever even find her again? Do you have any idea how many people are dreaming every night?

</dd>,<dd><b>Prismo</b>: Dude, it could take you a million years
</dd>,<dd><b>Cosmic Owl</b>: Then it would be worth it! For love! Forgot my sketchbook.

</dd>,<dd><b>Prismo</b>: (on TV, back at Cosmic Owl's motel.) and so then she's like, ""I really like you"" and I said ""I really like you too"" and then she said ""I don't wanna hold hands until I'm in love"" and I'm like ""that's great, I'm all about going slow"" and then she's like ""what? You don't wanna hold my hand?."" Ha ha! Okay, what is going on with that toothpick?
</dd>,<dd><b>Cosmic Owl</b>: Huh?
</dd>,<dd><b>Prismo</b>: I can get you a new toothpick.

</dd>,<dd><b>Cosmic Owl</b>: (flies into a dream with the bird woman on a floating piece of ice) Hi.
</dd>,<dd><b>Bird Woman</b>: Hi!
</dd>,<dd><b>Cosmic Owl</b>: Are there any appetizers?
</dd>,<dd><b>Bird Woman</b>: No, I think it's just ice in this dream. Oh I wish I could dream another place!
</dd>,<dd><b>Cosmic Owl</b>: I have an idea. (flies bird woman to his motel) My apartment.
</dd>,<dd><b>Bird Woman</b>: Oh.
</dd>,<dd><b>Cosmic Owl</b>: It's a bit of a mess. I'm not used to having company.
</dd>,<dd><b>Bird Woman</b>: No, it's got personality.
</dd>,<dd><b>Cosmic Owl</b>: I know right! Hey, do you like board games?
</dd>,<dd><b>Bird Woman</b>: Tell me about this.
</dd>,<dd><b>Cosmic Owl</b>: Oh, I use that for work.
</dd>,<dd><b>Bird Woman</b>: It's interesting.
</dd>,<dd><b>Cosmic Owl</b>: Hey, you wanna, spy on people's dreams?
</dd>,<dd><b>Bird Woman</b>: Can we?
</dd>,<dd><b>Cosmic Owl</b>: Sure! Hehehe.
</dd>,<dd><b>Bird Woman</b>: What's it like to have all this fingertips?
</dd>,<dd><b>Cosmic Owl</b>: I guess I just don't even think of it.
</dd>,<dd><b>Bird Woman</b>: But you're not powerful enough to see everyone's dreams, are you?
</dd>,<dd><b>Cosmic Owl</b>: I'm totally that powerful.
</dd>,<dd><b>Bird Woman</b>: Even royalty?
</dd>,<dd><b>Cosmic Owl</b>: Like <a href=""/wiki/Ice_King"" title=""Ice King"">Ice King</a> or something? His dreams are so sad.
</dd>,<dd><b>Bird Woman</b>: Like <a href=""/wiki/Princess_Bubblegum"" title=""Princess Bubblegum"">Princess Bubblegum</a>? Oh, surely she has some dream security system in place.
</dd>,<dd><b>Cosmic Owl</b>: Ha ha ha, we can go right now. Is that what this is about?
</dd>,<dd><b>Bird Woman</b>: Yes, let's go right now.
</dd>,<dd><b>Cosmic Owl</b>: Ahahaha this feels weird, it seemed like you really wanna go. It's okay to feel manipulated, right? (the two go)
</dd>,<dd><b>Candy People</b>: (cheering)
</dd>,<dd><b>Princess Bubblegum</b>: Oh thank you, thank you!
</dd>,<dd><b>Candy People</b>: Yay!!! Boooo!!!
</dd>,<dd><b>Princess Bubblegum</b>: After all I've done for you?
</dd>,<dd><b>Cosmic Owl</b>: Huh? Something's wrong. Does this dream seem weird to you? Hoo!
</dd>,<dd><b>Princess Bubblegum</b>: No. I worked so hard! Ahhhhh!
</dd>,<dd><b>Cosmic Owl</b>: Hey, hey you!
</dd>,<dd><b>Bird Woman</b>: Huh?
</dd>,<dd><b>Cosmic Owl</b>: no. What have you done? (flies back to motel) You interfered with a dream! Oh man, a dream I was in! Why did you do it?
</dd>,<dd><b>Bird Woman</b>: I just can't really explain. It felt like the right thing to do!
</dd>,<dd><b>Cosmic Owl</b>: You, you ruined everything! We would've been so perfect together. A— who am I kidding, it's over.
</dd>,<dd><b>Bird Woman</b>: It doesn't have to be over, we can run away, together!
</dd>,<dd><b>Cosmic Owl</b>: Your dreamin' kid, and it's time to wake up.
</dd>,<dd><b>Bird Woman</b>: No!
</dd>,<dd><b>Cosmic Owl</b>: Hoo!

Holly Jolly Secrets Part II/Transcript ,"<dd>[<i>The episode opens with <a href=""/wiki/Jake"" title=""Jake"">Jake</a> still screaming.</i>]
</dd>,<dd><b>Jake</b>:  ...AAAAAAAAAaaa [<i>singing</i>] aaaloutte, gentille Alouette, Alouette, je te plumerai. Je te plumerai la tête! Je te plumerai la tête! Alouette, [<i>Flopping lips with fingers</i>] je te plumerai!
</dd>,<dd>[<i><a href=""/wiki/Finn"" title=""Finn"">Finn</a> and <a href=""/wiki/BMO"" title=""BMO"">BMO</a> applaud him.</i>]
</dd>,<dd><b>Finn</b>:  Huh. I guess you <i>do</i> know all the words. Anyway, start the next video, BMO. We gotta crack the code on the <a href=""/wiki/Ice_King"" title=""Ice King"">Ice King</a>'s evil secret tapes!
</dd>,<dd>[<i>Outside, the Ice King finishes covering the Tree Fort with snow. He grunts angrily.</i>]
</dd>,<dd><b>Finn</b>:  Brrrr... You guys cold?
</dd>,<dd><b>Jake</b>:  Yeah, it's kinda chilly in here.
</dd>,<dd>[<i>Finn rewinds the tape. Ice King clears the snow to look through a window. Finn, Jake, and BMO are now wearing sweaters and have the fireplace lit.</i>]
</dd>,<dd><b>Ice King</b>:  [<i>To himself</i>] Agh... What's on those tapes...? I can kinda... make it out... Dang it, BMO, just turn to your right a little.... Ugh!! By the power of ice... I want your cup of cocoa to fall over. [<i>BMO's hot chocolate freezes, rises from the cup, and knocks the cup over.</i>] Yes! Now turn and pick it up... [<i>BMO turns of his own accord.</i>] Yes... Yes... [<i>Gasps as he views himself on BMO's screen</i>] That's... me? [<i>Beat</i>] THEY'RE WATCHING <i>MY</i> SECRET TAPES?! [<i>Goes away from window angrily</i>] And they're cozy. I'll show them. [<i>Makes snowman</i>] This snowman looks pretty good. [<i>Smiles</i>] Pretty darn good! [<i>He puts a face on it and laughs playfully.</i>]
</dd>,<dd>[<i>Inside, Finn and Jake are watching a tape of Ice King crying. A <a href=""/wiki/Penguins"" title=""Penguins"">penguin</a> comes up.</i>]
</dd>,<dd><b>Penguin [<i>On tape</i>]</b>:  Wenk.
</dd>,<dd><b>Ice King [<i>On tape</i>]</b>:  Could I have five more minutes, please?
</dd>,<dd>[<i>The penguin walks away; Ice King continues crying. Finn and Jake stare awkwardly at the screen. A screen bug pops up that says, ""You're watching AN ADVENTURE TIME CHRISTMAS SPECIAL—ON CN."" The video deactivates.</i>]
</dd>,<dd><b>BMO</b>:  I think I can break the code, Finn.
</dd>,<dd><b>Finn</b>:  Really?
</dd>,<dd><b>BMO</b>:  Yes. I have detected a noticeable pattern in the tears of sadness that fall from the Ice King's eyeballs. [<i>BMO demonstrates on the screen.</i>] His tears drop at an equal rate until the thirteenth tear, when the right eye drops two tears instead of one.
</dd>,<dd><b>Finn</b>:  Whoa...
</dd>,<dd><b>Jake</b>:  This is so fascinating...
</dd>,<dd><b>BMO</b>:  The thirteenth letter of the alphabet is ""M."" If I print the letter ""M"" every time the Ice King says an ""M"" word, it looks like this! [<i>Prints paper</i>]
</dd>,<dd><b>Finn</b>:  Oh, my Glob, Jake... Is this it? Could this be the Ice King's evil secret? [<i>The paper shows ASCII art of a penguin.] [Furiously ripping up paper</i>] WHAT DOES IT MEAN?!
</dd>,<dd>[<i>Outside, Ice King is pacing back and forth in front of a snowman army.</i>]
</dd>,<dd><b>Ice King</b>:  Some of you won't survive this. You'll melt or split in half or your head will fall off... but that's fine... because you're made of snow. Only one thing matters today! Getting into that tree house, getting my tapes back, and beating up Finn and Jake! [<i>Beat</i>] Maybe BMO. Yeah, BMO too! Who's with me?! [<i>No response</i>] Hey, why're you guys so quiet? Are you mad? [Snaps] Oh, that's right. You're not alive yet. My bad.
</dd>,<dd>[<i>He uses his ice magic to put life into the snowmen. The snowmen yell and grunt. Finn, Jake, and BMO notice the noise and run towards the window. When Finn opens the curtains, Ice King right in front of the window.</i>]
</dd>,<dd><b>Ice King</b>:  Gimme my tapes back.
</dd>,<dd><b>Finn</b>:  No, man! I know you've got evil secrets on these, and we're gonna find 'em!
</dd>,<dd><b>Ice King</b>:  Snowmen! Attack!
</dd>,<dd>[<i>The snowmen come towards Ice King and attack him.</i>]
</dd>,<dd><b>Finn</b>:  [<i>Closing curtain</i>] Crip, Jake! We gotta unravel these evil secrets at warp-crazy!
</dd>,<dd>[<i>The trio goes to the bedroom and hides under the bed to watch another tape.</i>]
</dd>,<dd><b>Ice King [<i>On tape</i>]</b>:  Good morning. You're watching the evening news. There's been an unfortunate event. Let's go talk to some witnesses. [<i>He turns the camera to an imprisoned <a href=""/wiki/Wildberry_Princess"" title=""Wildberry Princess"">Wildberry Princess</a>.</i>] Princess, what is your name?
</dd>,<dd><b>Wildberry Princess [<i>On tape</i>]</b>:  Please! Let me go home!
</dd>,<dd><b>Ice King</b>:  [<i>Jokingly</i>] So, Princess ""Please-let-me-go-home,"" what was it like to experience this tragedy?
</dd>,<dd><b>Wildberry Princess</b>:  What? [<i>Stammering</i>] I... I don't... uh... um...
</dd>,<dd><b>Ice King</b>:  Yeah, we're on air, honey, so spit it out.
</dd>,<dd><b>Wildberry Princess</b>:  I... I don't know what you're talking about.
</dd>,<dd><b>Ice King</b>:  Obviously traumatized and in a state of shock. Let's go ask somebody else something. [<i>Turns camera upside-down</i>] Upside-down Princess, do you think things will change politically because of today's events?
</dd>,<dd><b>Wildberry Princess</b>:  You're really frightening me.
</dd>,<dd><b>Ice King</b>:  Well, there ya have it, folks. People are very upset that Gunther tried to eat Ice King's socks! Very upset! That's why Gunther has to stay in the corner! [<i>Turns camera to a penguin</i>]
</dd>,<dd><b>Finn</b>:  Weird... [<i>A loud sound is heard</i>] He's sneakin' in through the chimney!
</dd>,<dd>[<i>Ice King busts horizontally though the chimney into the tree house.</i>]
</dd>,<dd><b>Ice King</b>:  Ah... The element of surprise... Ah, jeez, I'm filthy. [<i>Takes off robe</i>] Well, now I'm cleaner, but I'm also nakeder. [<i>Goes to another room and notices a table full of delicious-looking food.</i>] Ohh! Mmm... [Licks lips] Just what I need... [<i>He pulls the table cloth from under the dishes, shattering and spilling everything on the table.</i>] Hehehehe... [<i>Dons red cloth; goes to door and opens it to reveal four waiting snowmen</i>] Come on, come on!
</dd>,<dd>[<i>The snowmen enter the house. Ice King pulls out a locket with pictures of Finn and Jake in it to show the snowmen what they look like. The snowmen scour the house.</i>]
</dd>,<dd>[<i>Back in the bedroom, Finn and Jake are watching a tape of Ice King singing a cover of Marceline's Fry Song.</i>]
</dd>,<dd><b>Jake</b>:  Yeeeesh.....
</dd>,<dd>[<i>Back in the other room, a snowman opens the refrigerator and motions the other three snowmen to join him. The four snowmen look through the refrigerator. Ice King angrily shoos them away.</i>]
</dd>,<dd><b>Ice King</b>:  [<i>Whispering to a snowman looking in a fruit bowl</i>] They wouldn't be in the fruit bowl! [<i>The snowman has an apple stuck on his face.</i>] Ohhh! Well, look at you with your nose shining so bright! You're so unique! Hehe! I'll name you Red-nose, and make you leader of the pack! [<i>He accidentally knocks the apple off the snowman's face.</i>] Eh... Well, now you look boring. [<i>The snowman makes a devastated face. Ice King picks up the apple.</i>] You want somethin' done right, ya gotta do it yourself. [<i>Sticks apple on nose and smiles</i>]
</dd>,<dd>[<i>In the bedroom, Finn and Jake are watching another tape of Ice King crying. A snowman notices them and knocks the bed over, uncovering the trio.</i>]
</dd>,<dd><b>Ice King</b>:  Now gimme my evil tapes back!! They're supposed to be buried!! In the ground!! [<i>Fires ice blast at Finn and Jake, who dodge it.</i>] Snow goons!!
</dd>,<dd>[<i>While Finn and Jake fight, BMO goes into hiding.</i>]
</dd>,<dd><b>BMO</b>:  Oh, no!
</dd>,<dd><b>Jake</b>:  Don't worry, BMO!
</dd>,<dd>[<i>Jake grabs a snowman. Ice King freezes the snowman, trapping Jake. Finn fights another snowman.</i>]
</dd>,<dd><b>BMO</b>:  Finn! There is one more tape!
</dd>,<dd><b>Finn</b>:  Play it! His evil secret must be on that tape!!
</dd>,<dd><b>Ice King</b>:  [<i>Urging</i>] No, BMO, please don't play it.
</dd>,<dd>[<i>BMO does anyway. The final video activates. A human man is viewed on the screen.</i>]
</dd>,<dd><b>Simon [<i>On tape</i>]</b>:  Hello. My name is Simon Petrikov. I am recording this tape so that people will know my story.
</dd>,<dd><b>Ice King</b>:  Oh, no! Turn it off, BMO, turn it off!!
</dd>,<dd><b>Simon [<i>On tape</i>]</b>:  I was studying to be an antiquarian of ancient artifacts. Now, I never believed in the supernatural stuff myself—just had a fascination with superstitions... but everything changed when I came into contact with this item....
</dd>,<dd>[<i>Simon Petrikov slowly opens a safe and takes out a gem-encrusted crown. Finn and Jake look surprised.</i>]
</dd>,<dd><b>Finn and Jake</b>:  The Ice King!! [<i>Interested, they sit down to listen closer. Ice King comes closer as well.</i>]
</dd>,<dd><b>Simon</b>:  After purchasing this crown from an old dock worker in northern Scandinavia, I brought it home and excitedly showed my fiancée Betty, [<i>Putting crown on</i>] and jokingly put it on my head just for a laugh or something... and that's when it started... The visions... [Whispering] I fought with them... [Raising his voice, frightened] Shouted at them until I realized it wasn't real—it was the crown!! [<i>Taking crown off</i>] I quickly took it off... and saw my fiancée in front of me... [<i>Whispering</i>] looking at me with such contempt. What had I said? What had I done when I wore this crown? All I know is I never saw Betty again.
</dd>,<dd>[<i>Another recording activates. Simon now has paler hair, blue skin, and stubble on his chin.</i>]
</dd>,<dd><b>Simon</b>:  Since then, I see the visions always whether or not I wear the crown. They tell me the secrets... the secrets of the ice and snow... that the power of the crown will save me with its frost. I don't yet know what this means. As you can see, my skin is beginning to turn blue. My body temperature has been lowering at a supernatural rate, to what is now about 30°C. I don't know when it will end... I'm really scared...
</dd>,<dd>[<i>Another recording activates. Simon now has a white mustache and beard.</i>]
</dd>,<dd><b>Simon</b>:  I know my mind is changing... but I'm already too far gone to know what to do. I want people to know that... if I do things... if I do things that hurt anyone, please... please forgive me.
</dd>,<dd>[<i>Another recording activates. Simon now very closely resembles Ice King.</i>]
</dd>,<dd><b>Simon</b>:  Just watch over me until I can find a way out of this labyrinth in my brain and regain my sanity!! And then maybe Betty, my princess... maybe you will love me again. [<i>Sobbing</i>] Please love me again, Betty!!
</dd>,<dd>[<i>Ice King cries.</i>]
</dd>,<dd><b>Jake</b>:  Drrr-AMA bomb!!
</dd>,<dd><b>Ice King</b>:  Now you know my secret! You know... that I used to wear glasses! [<i>Sobs more</i>] Maybe kidnapping Wildberry Princess will cheer me up.
</dd>,<dd><b>Finn</b>:  Wait, Ice King. [<i>Dead serious</i>] BMO, eject tape, please. [<i>BMO ejects the tape, sending it flying into the case with the other tapes. Finn grabs the case and walks over to Ice King.</i>] Here, Ice King.
</dd>,<dd><b>Ice King</b>:  What's this? You're giving me... a gift.
</dd>,<dd><b>Finn</b>:  No... It's... well... These belong to you.
</dd>,<dd><b>Ice King</b>:  But it's not even my birthday! This is so exciting! [Opens case] Video tapes! Heh, you know, I had a bunch of these once, but I threw them away! This is great, Finn! Thank you!
</dd>,<dd><b>Jake</b>:  It's from me, too.
</dd>,<dd><b>Ice King</b>:  Oh! I have presents for you guys, too! [<i>Goes to get them; Finn and Jake look at each other.</i>] Here. It's a small pine tree. I chopped it down in one foul swoop! And this [<i>a skunk that is either stuffed or dead</i>] is for you!
</dd>,<dd><b>Jake</b>:  [<i>Taking skunk</i>] Uh... thanks.
</dd>,<dd><b>Ice King</b>:  Oh, isn't this fun?! We're giving each other presents, we're wearing silly clothes, there's snow everywhere... Let's do this every day!
</dd>,<dd><b>Jake</b>:  Uh...

In the past, the Soft People of this village enjoyed piling our gold in the center of town and dancing wildly around it. It was awesome [<i>laughs</i>]! But then, the Gut Grinder came and stole our pile of gold. So we adapted and learned how to hide our gold using a big cup. And it worked! The Gut Grinder didn't come back! But recently, and admittedly it was probably a bad idea, we took our gold out from under the cup and we put it in the center of town. Haha, 'cause--'cause we really like dancing around it! But, boy oh boy, was that a mistake. You know what happened?
</dd>,<dd><b>Finn</b>: Uhhh... it came back and ate all your gold?
</dd>,<dd><b>Old Soft Person</b>: [<i>crying</i>] Yes, oh, yes!
</dd>,<dd><b>Finn</b>: Aw, don't cry, Soft Old Man. I'll find this monster and bring peace to this village. I swear!
</dd>,<dd><b>Soft Person #1</b>: Swear to what?
</dd>,<dd><b>Finn</b>: I swear to justice!
</dd>,<dd><b>Soft People</b>: Whoa! He swears to justice!
</dd>,<dd><b>Finn</b>: Okay, so, what does he look like?
</dd>,<dd><b>Old Soft Person</b>: Ohh, it's so scary we usually close our eyes and go wee-wee when he attacks. But... [<i>walks over to footprint</i>] he left this footprint... [<i>Jake (giant-sized) storms in</i>] Wha--?
</dd>,<dd><b>Jake</b>: [<i>putting his foot in the print</i>] Yo, yo, yo, yo, yo, yo, yo, yo, yo, yo, yo!
</dd>,<dd><b>Soft Person #1</b>: Look! His paw matches the footprint!
</dd>,<dd>[<i>Soft People start murmuring, terrified.</i>]
</dd>,<dd><b>Soft Person #1</b>: I'm so scared, I'm gonna go wee-wee!
</dd>,<dd><b>Finn</b>: Whoa, no, no-no-no-no! Calm down, everybody. This is my friend, Jake the Dog.
</dd>,<dd><b>Soft Person #2</b>: [<i>sigh</i>] Thank goodness.
</dd>,<dd><b>Soft Person #1</b>: Yeah--I almost wee-wee'd!
</dd>,<dd><b>Jake</b>: Wait, you were gonna wee-wee if I was the Gut Grinder?
</dd>,<dd><b>Soft Person #1</b>: Oh, yeah! We're terrified of him.
</dd>,<dd><b>Jake</b>: [<i>loudly</i>] Then I am the Gut Grinder!
</dd>,<dd><b>Soft Person #1</b>: I'm gonna wee-wee! [<i>squirts liquid out of its armpits and spins around in a circle</i>]

</dd>,<dd><b>Finn</b>:  Yeah! Whoo-hoo-hoo! Yeah, Jake!
</dd>,<dd>[<i>Because Finn is blindfolded, he can't see where he's going, and his foot unintentionally knocks into the can of baked beans.</i>]
</dd>,<dd><b>Lumpy Space Princess</b>:  [<i>in slow motion</i>] Nooooooooo!
</dd>,<dd>[<i>Time seems to pass in slow motion as the baked beans spill all over the ground.</i>]

</dd>,<dd><b>Finn</b>:  You know we are.
</dd>,<dd><b>Booboo</b>:  Good. [<i>The ghosts all start kicking Finn and Jake.</i>]
</dd>,<dd><b>Finn</b>:  Ow! What's the point of this lesson?

</dd>,<dd><b>Georgy</b>:  See? They're fine.
</dd>,<dd><b>Wendy</b>:  When did <i>you</i> go all soft? You used to like teaching people about kicks. [<i>Marceline stares.</i>]
</dd>,<dd><b>Georgy</b>:  Hey, guys, I think you're ready to learn how to float. All you have to do is jump off that ledge. [<i>He glances up towards some derelict structures in the distance.</i>]
</dd>,<dd><b>Finn</b>:  Cool.
</dd>,<dd><b>Marceline</b>:  [<i>gasps</i>] W-wait! There's more beginner lessons you need to learn before floating. Like... uh... the spooky vampire walk. See? Spoooooky... wooo!
</dd>,<dd><b>Finn</b>:  Heh heh. No way.
</dd>,<dd><b>Jake</b>:  We wanna fly!
</dd>,<dd>[<i>The ghosts take them away. Marceline growls in anger and floats after them.</i>]
</dd>,<dd><b>Marceline</b>:  You guys stop right now.
</dd>,<dd><b>Georgy</b>:  Marceline, chill out. It's going to be okay. We've got a plan. [<i>to Finn and Jake</i>] Now, get in your flying positions. [<i>Georgy pushes them off the edge.</i>]
</dd>,<dd><b>Finn and Jake</b>:  VAMPIRES FOREVER!!! WOOO!
</dd>,<dd><b>Marceline</b>:  What are you guys waiting for? You said you had a plan.
</dd>,<dd><b>Wendy</b>:  We do. It's to let them die! [<i>The ghosts start laughing.</i>]
</dd>,<dd>[<i>Marceline is furious. Her eyes blaze with rage.

</dd>,<dd><b>Finn and Jake</b>:  We did it! Yeah! Woohoo! Awesome!

</dd>,<dd><b>Wendy</b>:  Yeah, you guys were pretty amazing.
</dd>,<dd><b>Booboo</b>:  Hey, we're gonna throw a party... in honor of your new vampire skills.
</dd>,<dd><b>Finn</b>:  Holy snaps, that's awesome!
</dd>,<dd><b>Marceline</b>:  They're <i>lying</i> to you guys. They just wanna suck the guts out of the top of your head.
</dd>,<dd><b>Finn, Jake, and ghosts</b>:  What?
</dd>,<dd><b>Booboo</b>:  She's just jealous of you.
</dd>,<dd>[<i>Wendy hands Finn and Jake an envelope.</i>]
</dd>,<dd><b>Wendy</b>:  We'll see you at midnight at our place. [<i>The ghosts turn invisible. Finn and Jake turn toward Marceline.</i>]
</dd>,<dd><b>Marceline</b>:  Guys, promise me you're going to that party.
</dd>,<dd><b>Finn</b>:  We're not gonna go.
</dd>,<dd><b>Marceline</b>:  You're not?
</dd>,<dd><b>Finn</b>:  Nah. I'm kinda tired from doing vampire stuff all day. We're just gonna chill.
</dd>,<dd><b>Marceline</b>:  Oh. Okay.
</dd>,<dd><b>Finn</b>:  Well, we're going back home.
</dd>,<dd><b>Jake</b>:  Peace.

</dd>,<dd>[<i>Georgy, Wendy, and Booboo have changed. They have significantly increased in size, are wearing laced collars, and have menacing eyes and puckered lips. Georgy closes the door.

</dd>,<dd><b>Finn</b>:  Uh... [<i>He shrieks in horror as one of the ghosts puts a mouth on his head. Jake tries to punch the ghosts' mouths away, but one gets him from behind.</i>] Georgy, what's wrong? Jake, what's happening?
</dd>,<dd><b>Jake</b>:  I think they're testing our vampire abilities.
</dd>,<dd><b>Finn</b>:  Oh, sweet. VAMPIRE KICK! [<i>Finn leaps in the air, but gets knocked away and lands on top of the chandelier.</i>]
</dd>,<dd><b>Georgy</b>:  Aw, come on. Will you knock it off already?
</dd>,<dd><b>Wendy</b>:  You know you're not even real vampires.
</dd>,<dd><b>Finn</b>:  Pssh. Then why am I flying, Wendy? [<i>realizes</i>] Oh. [<i>The chandelier breaks loose. finn falls screaming to the floor.</i>] Yo, man. I think Marceline tricked us.
</dd>,<dd><b>Jake</b>:  Yeah.
</dd>,<dd>[<i>The ghosts' mouths start to close in on our heroes when Marceline suddenly appears out of nowhere.</i>]
</dd>,<dd><b>Marceline</b>:  VAMPIRE KICK!!! [<i>She kicks the ghosts' mouths away.</i>] Finn. Jake. I'm so sorry I got you into this. I should've never pranked you so perfectly.
</dd>,<dd><b>Finn</b>:  It's okay. You're here now to beat up those ghosts and save us.
</dd>,<dd><b>Marceline</b>:  Oh, no, vampires can't beat ghosts. It's sort of a Rock-Paper-Scissors thing. I just came to apologize.
</dd>,<dd><b>Finn</b>:  Aw, man. [<i>The ghosts' mouths pick up Jake and Finn and start sucking on their heads.</i>] I can't believe we're gonna die just because we wanted to be comfortable watching <i>Heat Signature</i>. [<i>Suddenly, the ghosts drop Finn.</i>]
</dd>,<dd><b>Georgy</b>:  Uh... did you guys say... <i>Heat Signature</i>?
</dd>,<dd>[<i>The scene cuts to a clip from the movie</i> Heat Signature. <i>A <a href=""/wiki/Commander_and_Private"" title=""Commander and Private"">Commander and Private</a> are inside a submarine, looking at a scanner.</i>]

</dd>,<dd><b>Commander</b>:  Well, spit it out, man!
</dd>,<dd><b>Private</b>:  I... I... I can't seem to locate... <i>our</i> heat signature.
</dd>,<dd>[<i>The scene reverts back to Marceline's living room. Marceline and the ghosts are watching in awe while Finn and Jake struggle about on the uncomfortable furniture, looking none too pleased.</i>]
</dd>,<dd><b>Finn</b>:  [<i>groans in frustration</i>] This stink-ups mega bam-bam to the J-stop. Could we just go back to the brain-eating or whatever?

</dd>,<dd><b>Jake</b>:  Don't have to smooch. You just have to bring someone you <i>can</i> smooch. It's, like, the rules.

</dd>,<dd><b>Princess Bubblegum</b>:  Sounds romantic, Finn.
</dd>,<dd><b>Finn</b>:  No! I was just wondering if you wanted to go with me. [<i>Begins to blush.]</i>

</dd>,<dd><b>Marceline</b>:  Hey, look, Finn, I know Jake's your friend and all, but... if you really want Bubblegum to go to the movies with you, you've gotta like, stop taking advice from your dog and take some advice from a real girl!
</dd>,<dd><b>Finn</b>:  But Jake said Phase 2 is powerful!
</dd>,<dd><b>Marceline</b>:  [<i>Blows raspberry.</i>] How is Jake going to know what girls want more than a real girl?
</dd>,<dd><b>Finn</b>:  Yeah...
</dd>,<dd><b>Marceline</b>:  Okay great. So what we need now is something... fun! Girls love fun more than anything. Fun, fun, fun! If you can show Princess Bubblegum you're fun, she'll deffs wanna go to the movies with you.

</dd>,<dd><b>Marceline</b>:  So... what do you like to do for fun, Finn?
</dd>,<dd><b>Finn</b>:  Oh, Oh! I like to wrestle! And fight! [<i>Makes fighting sounds &amp; positions.</i>] But girls don't like that.
</dd>,<dd><b>Marceline</b>:  No, no, that's perfect! All you need to do is get in there and wrestle Princess Bubblegum to show her how fun you are. [<i>Floats away.</i>]

</dd>,<dd><b>Jake</b>:  What she talking about, Finn?
</dd>,<dd><b>Finn</b>:  Well... I was going to give Marceline's plan a try, too.
</dd>,<dd><b>Jake</b>:  Her idea?! What's wrong with my idea? [<i>Marceline flicks her tongue at Jake.</i>]

</dd>,<dd><b>Princess Bubblegum</b>: Guards!
</dd>,<dd>[<i>Finn is thrown out of the castle. Jake comes out of the hole in the lute, breaking the strings and falls, dizzy. Marceline sits down next to him and turns back to normal.</i>]
</dd>,<dd><b>Marceline</b>:  That suit was ridiculous.
</dd>,<dd><b>Jake</b>:  Ridi—Ridiculous? What? Can you believe this girl, Finn? Huh? Can ya?
</dd>,<dd><b>Finn</b>:  Uh... I guess the suit did feel... a little silly.
</dd>,<dd><b>Jake</b>:  Well, fine! You can just give it back then!

</dd>,<dd><b>Finn</b>:  I'm sorry!
</dd>,<dd><b>Jake</b>:  Good luck getting to that movie without my help! Ruff. [<i>Stretches away.</i>]
</dd>,<dd><b>Marceline</b>:  Gee, he seems pretty ticked.
</dd>,<dd><b>Finn</b>:  Naw, he just needs some spaghetti.
</dd>,<dd><b>Marceline</b>:  Oh, okay. Well taste this, then. I've gotta a new plan.
</dd>,<dd><b>Finn</b>:  Really?
</dd>,<dd><b>Marceline</b>:  The only thing women like more than fun is excitement! She needs to feel her blood pump, man! She needs to... be chased by wolves!
</dd>,<dd><b>Finn</b>:  Like metaphorically?
</dd>,<dd><b>Marceline</b>:  Come on, I'll teach ya how to show a girl a good time. <i>Wraps Finn's arms around her.</i>] Hold tight. You ready?
</dd>,<dd><b>Finn</b>:  Uhh... [<i>Holds tighter.</i>] Mhmm.
</dd>,<dd>[<i>Marceline takes off and laughs. They fly above a pack of running wolves and start to run with them.

Finn and Marceline begin to ride on the back of two wolves. Marceline and Finn fly two wolves to the Candy Kingdom and outside of Princess Bubblegum's room.</i>]
</dd>,<dd><b>Marceline</b>:  Shhh! She's probably asleep!
</dd>,<dd>[<i>They put the wolves into Princess Bubblegum's room and close the door.</i>]
</dd>,<dd><b>Finn</b>:  This was a really good idea.
</dd>,<dd><b>Marceline</b>:  [<i>Turns into a bat.</i>] Now don't blow it this time!
</dd>,<dd><b>Finn</b>:  Haha, okay.
</dd>,<dd>[<i>Princess Bubblegum screams, runs out of her room and struggles to close the door behind her. She notices Finn.</i>]
</dd>,<dd><b>Princess Bubblegum</b>:  Oh, Finn, thank goodness you're here! There's wolves in my room!
</dd>,<dd><b>Finn</b>:  Yeah, I know! I put them there! Pretty exciting, right? Heh heh.

</dd>,<dd><b>Princess Bubblegum</b>:  [<i>Sadly</i>] I'm sorry to do this, Finn. But until you stop acting like a psycho, you're forbidden from entering the Candy Kingdom. Farewell. [<i>Walks back into the castle, a pretzel gate sliding closed behind her. A duck quacks, and poos on him.</i>]
</dd>,<dd><b>Finn</b>:  I don't understand, Marceline. I tried everything. I guess she just doesn't like me. [<i>Marceline puts a finger to his lips.</i>]
</dd>,<dd><b>Marceline</b>:  Shhh. Come on, Finn, a brainlord like Bonnie? You'll be bored with her in a week! And anyway I, for one, think you're pretty great. [<i>Kisses Finn on the cheek.</i>] Sorry it didn't work out the way you wanted. See you later, I guess! [<i>Flies away.</i>]
</dd>,<dd><b>Finn</b>:  Marceline! Of course! It's been Marceline all along!
</dd>,<dd><b>Jake</b>:  Hey, man, I've been looking for you. Sorry for acting like a dweeb before. Want some leftover spaghetti?
</dd>,<dd><b>Finn</b>:  Ah, no, thanks, man. But I really need your help!

</dd>,<dd><b>Finn</b>:  With you, I would walk down any road, m'lady. Especially, if it leads to the movies.
</dd>,<dd><b>Marceline</b>:  Oh, yeah? No one would want to go to the movies with... [<i>Turns into a giant tenctacle monster</i>] <i>this!</i> [<i>Laughs evilly and picks up Finn.</i>] What do you think of me now?
</dd>,<dd><b>Finn</b>:  How do you like your popcorn?
</dd>,<dd><b>Marceline</b>:  Uuugh! [<i>Turns back to normal.</i>] You're starting to annoy me!
</dd>,<dd><b>Finn</b>:  Well then let's do something fun, like go to the movies!

</dd>,<dd><b>Marceline</b>:  No! [<i>Pushes Finn off</i>] Listen to me. I'm not going to go to the movies with you! I just don't like you... that way.
</dd>,<dd>[<i>Finn lies down on the couch, sad.</i>]
</dd>,<dd><b>Marceline</b>:  I'm sorry Finn, I just... I don't wanna date you.
</dd>,<dd><b>Finn</b>:  Date me? Man, I just wanna go to the movies. But everybody hates me.
</dd>,<dd><b>Marceline</b>:  Wait, you don't want me to be your girlfriend?
</dd>,<dd><b>Finn</b>:  Huh? No! Movies!
</dd>,<dd><b>Marceline</b>:  If you weren't looking for a girlfriend then why were you romancing it up all day?
</dd>,<dd><b>Finn</b>:  'Cause Jake said Couples Night had weird kissing requirements and romance initiation rituals and whatever else.
</dd>,<dd><b>Jake</b>:  I didn't really say all that. [<i>Mumbles something and hides behind couch.</i>]

</dd>,<dd><b>Finn</b>:  Answer this!

</dd>,<dd>[<i>They finish the obstacle course. The scene changes to <a href=""/wiki/Finn"" title=""Finn"">Finn</a> and <a href=""/wiki/Jake"" title=""Jake"">Jake</a> observing the caterpillar family. Muffled cheering and laughter in the background</i>]
</dd>,<dd><b>Finn</b>: Hmm. Why would I need to learn about caterpillar families? I don't get it.
</dd>,<dd>[<i>Cheering and laughing continue as the scene changes to the Candy Children eating candy leaves. Finn and Jake observe them from the back.</i>]
</dd>,<dd><b>Jake</b>: Well, they look like they're having fun.
</dd>,<dd><b>Finn</b>: [<i>Scoffs</i>] Real leaves aren't made out of candy. They always have a gross, bitter taste.
</dd>,<dd>[<i>The scene changes to the children now eating candy caterpillars.</i>]
</dd>,<dd><b>Candy Child</b>: Whee! [<i>laughs</i>]
</dd>,<dd><b>Candy Child (Terry)</b>: Terry eats all the caterpillars!
</dd>,<dd><b>Candy Child 2</b>: Mmm! Ah, it's so good!

</dd>,<dd><b>Finn</b>: Ugh. That's gross, too. There's no way real caterpillars are delicious.
</dd>,<dd><b>Jake</b>: You think? I bet they taste great if you're a boid.
</dd>,<dd>[<i>The scene changes to a close up of a food chain wheel as it changes its image on it about every three seconds. <a href=""/wiki/Princess_Bubblegum"" title=""Princess Bubblegum"">Princess Bubblegum</a> appears to be teaching the Candy Children about the Food Chain.</i>]
</dd>,<dd><b>Princess Bubblegum</b>: The caterpillar eats the leaf. Then the bird eats the caterpillar. Then the big bird eats the little bird. The big bird then dies, and its remains decompose into rich, fertile soil And from that soil, a new plant bursts to life. And then the caterpillar eats the plant again. And so the circle of life continues. This is a law of nature we call the food chain.
</dd>,<dd>[<i>The shot zooms out where can visually see Princess Bubblegum and the children at the Food Chain wheel.</i>]
</dd>,<dd><b>Princess Bubblegum</b>: Isn't that fascinating?

</dd>,<dd><b>Finn</b>: No way I'm eating a bug's butt. Those kids are right. Whats the big deez about the food chain, anyway? Lets hit the snack bar and eat something yummy.
</dd>,<dd>[<i>From behind, <a href=""/wiki/Magic_Man"" title=""Magic Man"" class=""mw-redirect"">Magic Man</a>, up to no good again, uses his magic to transform Finn and Jake into birds.

</dd>,<dd><b>Jake</b>: Hey, have you noticed we are birds now?
</dd>,<dd><b>Finn</b>: I'm hungies.
</dd>,<dd>[<i>The camera angle pans down where an oasis is seen from a distance.</i>

</dd>,<dd>[<i>Jake swipes a bunch of caterpillars on a leaf in the air.</i>]
</dd>,<dd><b>Jake</b>: Bon appetit!
</dd>,<dd>[<i>The caterpillars which Jake swiped in the air now fall into his mouth.</i>]
</dd>,<dd><b>Jake</b>: [<i>Gulps</i>]
</dd>,<dd><b>Finn</b>: Oh, dude, you ate those?!
</dd>,<dd><b>Jake</b>: Come on, man. We're sweet, sweet birds, and we get to eat worms. This is a unique experience.

</dd>,<dd><b>Jake</b>: Dude, you've been eating grubs for hours.
</dd>,<dd><b>Finn</b>: What?!
</dd>,<dd><b>Jake</b>: Yeah, you're a beast.
</dd>,<dd>[<i>The shadow of a big bird is seen coming closer to Finn and Jake. The scene switches to a big bird trying to grab Finn and Jake. Both screaming, Finn and Jake dodge from the big birds claws. A beat plays in the background as Finn and Jake try to fly away.</i>]
</dd>,<dd><b>Finn</b>: Help me, Jake! My body's too bloated to fly!
</dd>,<dd><b>Jake</b>: Hide!
</dd>,<dd>[<i>Finn cowers. The big bird is now confused as Finn is hiding. It flies away, but it notices Finn escaping from his cowering position. Finn continues flapping but is too bloated to levitate, not realizing that the big bird is watching him. The big bird then dives down to snatch up Finn.</i>]
</dd>,<dd><b>Finn</b>: [<i>Grunting</i>]
</dd>,<dd>[<i>Just before the bird grabs Finn, Magic Man changes Finn into the big bird, and the little bird barely escapes. Talk about your close call...</i>]
</dd>,<dd><b>Finn</b>: [<i>Grunts</i>] There goes my din-din. Why am I hungry again?
</dd>,<dd>[<i>Finn is now flying higher and eventually starts flying with Jake.</i>]
</dd>,<dd><b>Finn</b>: Jake!
</dd>,<dd><b>Jake</b>: Who are you?
</dd>,<dd><b>Finn</b>: It's me, Finn.
</dd>,<dd><b>Jake</b>: Dang, when did you get so big?... And old?
</dd>,<dd><b>Finn</b>: [<i>Stomach growls</i>]
</dd>,<dd>[<i>Finn starts to hallucinate and sees Jake as a piece of meat.</i>]
</dd>,<dd><b>Jake</b>: You feeling okay, bro?
</dd>,<dd><b>Finn</b>: Jake, we are good friends. So let me just say you look awesome right now.
</dd>,<dd><b>Jake</b>: Ha, really?
</dd>,<dd><b>Finn</b>: Yeah.
</dd>,<dd>[<i>The scene switches back to Finn hallucinating and seeing Jake as a piece of meat.</i>]
</dd>,<dd><b>Finn</b>: You're looking tasty. [<i>Muffled</i>] Hey, why don't you take a seat in my mouth?
</dd>,<dd><b>Jake</b>: Why? That's... weird.
</dd>,<dd><b>Finn</b>: It's okay. It's okay. Just give it a try. It's a new experience, right?
</dd>,<dd>[<i>The scene changes to Jake in Finn's mouth.</i>]
</dd>,<dd><b>Jake</b>: Wow, you have a lot of saliva. [<i>Chuckles</i>] You must have a broken pipe, old timer. It's comfy, though.
</dd>,<dd>[<i>Finn then tries to eat Jake by closing his beak but Jake quickly escapes.</i>]
</dd>,<dd><b>Finn</b>: [<i>Chomps</i>]
</dd>,<dd><b>Jake</b>: Whoa! Did you just try to eat me?!
</dd>,<dd><b>Finn</b>: No...? But if I did that'd be okay, right?
</dd>,<dd>[<i>Jake flies closer next to Finn's face.</i>]
</dd>,<dd><b>Jake</b>: You <i>are</i> trying to eat me.
</dd>,<dd><b>Finn</b>: I'm just following the Law of Nature.
</dd>,<dd><b>Jake</b>: What're you talking about?
</dd>,<dd><b>Finn</b>: I don't know. I just feel that way. [<i>Chomps as he tries to eat Jake again</i>]
</dd>,<dd><b>Jake</b>: [<i>Groans</i>]
</dd>,<dd>[<i>Jake flies away.</i>]
</dd>,<dd><b>Finn</b>: Aw, Jake, you're missing out... by not getting eaten... by me.
</dd>,<dd>[<i>Jake flies away.</i>]
</dd>,<dd><b>Jake</b>: Sorry, man. I'm not into it.
</dd>,<dd>[<i>Weak from hunger, Finn falls and hits the ground with a thud. The scene changes to an Irish beat playing as Finn lies on the ground, dying as the sun sets before him.</i>]
</dd>,<dd><b>Finn</b>: So alone. So hungry. [<i>weakly</i>] The Law of Nature... has claimed this... bod... [<i>Groaning weakly</i>]
</dd>,<dd>[<i>Thus ends Finn's life as a bird and the scene fades to black. The scene now changes to Finn's next life as a bunch of bacteria. The change like Finn changing from a small bird to a big bird happens again. This time, Finn has changed from a big bird to bacteria -</i> trillions <i>of 'em.</i>]
</dd>,<dd><b>Finn</b>: Yay! What a big turnout. Top notch! To decompose stuff! Yeah-h-h! We are so pumped! Yeah! [<i>Sniffs</i>] What's that smell?
</dd>,<dd>[<i>The scene has changed to a bird (in Finn's hallucination) made out of fruits and food, which interests Finn as bacteria</i>]
</dd>,<dd><b>Finn</b>: Wow. It looks amazing! Yay! Yay!
</dd>,<dd>[<i>Wavy colorful lines appear shining out beside the bird.</i>]
</dd>,<dd><b>Finn</b>: Party time!
</dd>,<dd>[<i>The scene changes back to Finn as bacteria</i>]
</dd>,<dd><b>Finn</b>: So good! Awesome. This bird went bad so well!
</dd>,<dd>[<i>Jake - also a bacteria - now appears positioned out of the hundred Finn bacteria</i>]
</dd>,<dd><b>Jake</b>: You took it too far, man. I'm a dog, and I eat all kinds of horrible things. <i>This</i> is disgusting.
</dd>,<dd><b>Finn</b>: Come on, think of it as a conversation starter—like, ""The other night, I ate the grossest thing I've ever tasted."" You know, it's interesting. [<i>Gulping</i>]
</dd>,<dd>[<i>The scene changes back to the bird now already consumed by Finn as bacteria, little more than a skeleton.</i>]
</dd>,<dd><b>Finn</b>: Whew! I'm full.
</dd>,<dd>[<i>A whooshing sound is suddenly heard. A strong breeze starts blowing as the Finn bacteria grab the ground.</i>]
</dd>,<dd><b>Finn</b>: Whoa! Aah!
</dd>,<dd>[<i>Some of the Finn bacteria fly off, and the scene changes to a closeup of the bacteria holding on to the skeleton of the bird.</i>]
</dd>,<dd><b>Finn</b>: Whoa! Aah! Whoa! Aah! What's going on?! Whoa!
</dd>,<dd>[<i>The camera angle goes through all the bacteria, and the scene changes as the background color turns green. Three leaves sprout, and Finn and Jake turn into flowers.</i>]
</dd>,<dd><b>Finn</b>: [<i>Burps</i>]
</dd>,<dd>[<i>The song ""<a href=""/wiki/We%27re_Plants"" title=""We're Plants"">We're Plants</a>"" starts to play as the surroundings rapidly change from day to afternoon to night (a day</i> is <i>short to a plant). Finn and Jake (as flowers) get eaten by caterpillars (as indicated by the ""Caterpillars"" bubbles pointing to the swirly vortices eating away at their leaves), and two birds fly in and eat the caterpillars just in the nick of time. The camera zooms into Finn's face towards the end of the song. Static ends the song (apologies for technical difficulties).</i>]
</dd>,<dd>[<i>The scene changes. The first shot is the sun, and the surroundings are full of fire.</i>]
</dd>,<dd><b>Finn and Jake</b>: [<i>Laughing</i>]
</dd>,<dd><b>Finn</b>: [<i>Panting</i>]
</dd>,<dd><b>Finn</b>: I think we're safe now... and also caterpillars.
</dd>,<dd><b>Jake</b>: [<i>Breathing heavily</i>]
</dd>,<dd>[<i>As the camera angle pans down, we notice that Finn and Jake have changed into caterpillars. Out of the frying pan, into the fire...</i>]
</dd>,<dd><b>Jake</b>: We're still in a bind, man. No food, no water.
</dd>,<dd><b>Finn</b>: I'm hungry.
</dd>,<dd><b>Jake</b>: I'm thirsty.
</dd>,<dd>[<i>As the camera angle pans to the side of Finn and Jake, another caterpillar appears in the distance.</i>]
</dd>,<dd><b>Jake</b>: [<i>Panting</i>] Hey, look.
</dd>,<dd>[<i>The camera shows a closeup of Erin's face.</i>]
</dd>,<dd><b>Jake</b>: It's another caterpillar.
</dd>,<dd>[<i>Back to Finn and Jake, Finn's eyes are replaced with pounding hearts - love at first sight.</i>]
</dd>,<dd><b>Jake</b>: Huh? You okay? [<i>Jake waves his hand over Finn's eyes.</i>]
</dd>,<dd><b>Finn</b>: She's beautiful.
</dd>,<dd><b>Jake</b>: She's just a caterpillar, dude.
</dd>,<dd>[<i>Back to the closeup of Erin's face, she starts to faint.</i>]
</dd>,<dd><b>Jake</b>: Looks like she's gonna faint.
</dd>,<dd><b>Erin</b>: [<i>Whimpering</i>]
</dd>,<dd>[<i>Erin finally faints and falls to the ground.</i>]
</dd>,<dd><b>Jake</b>: You see?
</dd>,<dd>[<i>Finn isn't there and appears to be trying to rescue Erin.</i>]
</dd>,<dd><b>Jake</b>: Huh. ""Love is Blind""—that must apply to all species.
</dd>,<dd>[<i>Now Finn, Jake, and Erin are traveling together.</i>]
</dd>,<dd><b>Jake</b>: Oh, I see. Your name is Erin, and there's a famine near your town, so that's why you're out here searching for an oasis.
</dd>,<dd><b>Erin</b>: Yes, I have to hurry and find food. Otherwise, my family won't survive. [<i>Weakly</i>] But I don't know if I can go on... [<i>Thunk</i>]
</dd>,<dd>[<i>Erin faints again, and Finn holds her.</i>]
</dd>,<dd><b>Finn</b>: Hold on, Erin. Food! Water! Shade! Where are you?!
</dd>,<dd>[<i>An oasis is seen in the distance. And not a moment too soon.</i>]
</dd>,<dd><b>Jake</b>: Over there—the oasis!
</dd>,<dd>[<i>They stare at the oasis. Erin eats a bit of a leaf while Finn eats a lot of it.</i>]
</dd>,<dd><b>Finn</b>: [<i>Muffled</i>] Yummy!
</dd>,<dd><b>Jake</b>: Really? You like leaves now?
</dd>,<dd><b>Finn</b>: So good, dude.
</dd>,<dd>[<i>Erin and Finn eat on the same leaf and bump their heads together. They both blush.</i>]
</dd>,<dd><b>Finn</b>: [<i>Gasps</i>] Your eyes.
</dd>,<dd>[<i>Jake starts eating a lot of leaves and breaks up the conversation between Erin and Finn.</i>]
</dd>,<dd><b>Jake</b>: Hey, hey, hey, move over a bit. I got a rhythm going here.
</dd>,<dd>[<i>Jake leaves. Finn and Erin hold hands as they sit on a leaf by the sunset. Jake is on the underside of the leaf.</i>]
</dd>,<dd><b>Erin</b>: I've never been this happy.
</dd>,<dd><b>Jake</b>: [<i>chuckles</i>] [<i>imitating Finn</i>] This oasis is pretty romantic, huh?
</dd>,<dd><b>Erin</b>: Sure, I guess.
</dd>,<dd><b>Jake</b>: So, how many kids you want to have?
</dd>,<dd><b>Finn</b>: Uh, [<i>stuttering</i>] d-d-do you want to get married?
</dd>,<dd><b>Erin</b>: Yes!
</dd>,<dd>[<i>And with that, the scene changes to a shot of flower bells ringing at Finn and Erin's wedding in the oasis. Jake acts as the priest.</i>]
</dd>,<dd><b>Jake</b>: And will you, Finn, take this caterpillar to be your wife, even if she becomes a flower or a bird or a bacteria, to love and to cherish till death do you part?
</dd>,<dd><b>Finn</b>: Y-y-y-yes.
</dd>,<dd>[<i>All the other caterpillars start cheering and an electronic version of Mendelssohn's wedding march plays.</i>]
</dd>,<dd><b>Jake</b>: You may now kiss the bride.
</dd>,<dd>[<i>As Finn tries to kiss Erin, much to the ""aww"" of the audience, uninvited guests in the form of two birds appear in the distance that eventually crash the wedding, their presence interrupting the kiss and causing general mass hysteria, and dine in on some caterpillars.</i>]
</dd>,<dd><b>Finn</b>: This way, Erin!
</dd>,<dd>[<i>Caterpillars get swiped into the air.</i>]
</dd>,<dd><b>Caterpillar</b>: Hey, is that my butt? Man, it's been a while!
</dd>,<dd>[<i>Finn and Erin are falling.</i>]
</dd>,<dd><b>Erin</b>: Finn!
</dd>,<dd><b>Finn</b>: When we're reborn as caterpillars, I'll marry you all over again!
</dd>,<dd><b>Erin</b>: That's beautiful, Finn! But when we're bacteria, I might see other people!
</dd>,<dd>[<i>Right before Finn falls into the bird's mouth, Magic Man changes Finn into a bird (and not a moment too soon) - and Finn chokes on the caterpillars. Now the scene changes back to Finn as a human. Finn has been dreaming this whole time, and in reality he is choking on candy caterpillars. He spits them out on the table. They are in the snack bar.</i>]
</dd>,<dd><b>Jake</b>: Hey, why are you eating caterpillars?
</dd>,<dd>[<i>The scene changes to Finn in his mind, hallucinating.</i>]
</dd>,<dd><b>Finn</b>: My eyes are open.
</dd>,<dd>[<i>Finn recaps the words Princess Bubblegum used to teach the kids about the food chain.</i>]
</dd>,<dd><b>Princess Bubblegum</b>: The caterpillar eats the leaf. Then the bird eats the caterpillar. Then the big bird eats the little bird then dies and its remains decompose into rich, fertile soil. And from that soil, a new plant bursts to life. And then the caterpillar eats the plant again.

Oh! I almost forgot! [<i>He makes a fanfare tune</i>] Do do-do do-Do! [<i>He pulls out a ring and puts it on his toe</i>] It’s a wife ring!

[<i>For each example, a still from the corresponding grayble appears</i>] You see, Jake ate a SWEET plum. Marceline played some SAVORY licks. Tree Trunks had a SOUR taste inside her mouth. Oh my. Gunter wanted to drink the SALTY tears. And Football's tea was BITTER. [<i>He laughs until he supposedly hears something</i>] Huh? What’s that you say? You thought the theme was the five fingers? [<i>he laughs</i>] Don’t be silly! No one’s had five fingers for twenty blablillion glaybles. Five telepathy glands maybe. [<i>he calms down</i>] Ah… slimmin’.

</dd>,<dd><b>Jake</b>: There's no need. I've got it figured out. The tremors are happening because Jake is hungry, [<i>pats belly</i>] and his stomach is growling. And the hungrier he gets, the worse the quakes will become.

</dd>,<dd><b>Evergreen</b>: ""<i>Discuss</i>""?! Are you listening, Chatsberry? Once this comet hits, everybody <i>dies.</i> Not just everybody, <i>but</i> us, but <i>us!</i>
</dd>,<dd><b>Balthus</b>: Now, now, hold on, Evergreen. Hath not a comet impacted our world every thousand years with no lasting grievousness?
</dd>,<dd><b>Evergreen</b>: Ahh, but this, Balthus, is no ordinary comet. Behold!

</dd>,<dd><b>Chatsberry</b>: But Evergreen, even if the comet <i>is</i> as dangerous as you say, what can we possibly do?
</dd>,<dd><b>Evergreen</b>: We build a crown.
</dd>,<dd><b>Chatsberry</b>: ""A crown""?
</dd>,<dd><b>Evergreen</b>: Like none seen before, or ever after! A magical crown whose phantasmal circuitry will bond to its first bearer and grant him his one deepest wish... [<i>yelling</i>] to destroy the hideous comet which threatens our world! The good news is I already built the crown. The bad news: it needs a power source. [<i>yelling</i>] The enchanted Ruby Eyes of the ancient lava dog, Magwood! And that's where <i>you</i> come in.
</dd>,<dd><b>Chatsberry</b>: Wait, <i>wait!</i> Evergreen, please. Wish Magic is really the <i>real deal</i>! This wish may see things in you you cannot see yourself. Can you truly say you know your heart's truest desire?
</dd>,<dd><b>Balthus</b>: I'm with Chatsberry. If this comet hits, we four indeed may perish. But the Elements we embody — Fire, Ice, Candy, and Slime — will live on! But a misplaced wish could cause irreversible damage to the very structure of existence!

</dd>,<dd><b>Gunther</b>: Master Evergreen, I found the water so you could build a—oh, [<i>sees ice tent and hears a sleeping Evergreen</i>] I guess he also found water, too.
</dd>,<dd><b>Ice Imp</b>: [<i>Gunther takes blanket</i>] Heeeeey?!
</dd>,<dd>[<i>Evergreen, Gunther, and Nina stand on a block of ice that moves slowly down a river of flowing lava. They then enter the area of Magwood.</i>]
</dd>,<dd><b>Evergreen</b>: Now, Gunther, listen to me. Don't follow me into Magwood's lair or else he'll melt your dome!
</dd>,<dd><b>Gunther</b>: [<i>Disappointed</i>] Yeah...
</dd>,<dd>[<i>Evergreen walks around the corner.</i>]
</dd>,<dd><b>Evergreen</b>: [<i>pointedly</i>] Oh, Gunther! You should <i>see</i> this!
</dd>,<dd><b>Gunther</b>: Okay!
</dd>,<dd><b>Evergreen</b>: [<i>Taps his nose</i>] Gunther, no! You failed; he'll melt your dome.
</dd>,<dd>[<i>Evergreen enters the lair, and sees a small Magwood sleeping on a column.</i>]
</dd>,<dd><b>Evergreen</b>: [<i>to himself</i>] Not as grand as you once were, eh?
</dd>,<dd>[<i>Evergreen steps on a small skeleton. The sound is enough to awaken Magwood, whose size increases.</i>] [<i>Outside of the lair, Gunther worryingly fidgets and cringes at the sounds he hears as his master and Magwood battle. He gets up and walks in to the lair.</i>]
</dd>,<dd><b>Gunther</b>: Master Evergreen, I'm sorry, but I got worried. Yeeeee!!
</dd>,<dd>[<i>An enraged Magwood has chased Evergreen to a hanging stalactite. The wizard blasts ice at the creature, who then bites at the stalactite. Evergreen falls into a pit as lava encroaches from above.</i>]
</dd>,<dd><b>Gunther</b>: Ah! Oh, boy! Uh, maybe maybe maybe, maybe I can do magic! [<i>Looks at his hands</i>] Like Master Evergreen. Bah! Ice! Flah, sorry... [<i>He steps back only to trip over the same skeleton as Evergreen. This again catches the attention of Magwood.</i>]
</dd>,<dd>[<i>The basket of bottles spill, and the bongo-playing ice imp is released.</i>]
</dd>,<dd><b>Gunther</b>: Shh!
</dd>,<dd><b>Ice Imp</b>: That's what you get! [<i>Magwood approaches and roars. Lava shoots from his mouth and lands on the imp, melting him</i>] Heeeey....
</dd>,<dd><b>Evergreen</b>: [<i>With Magwood distracted, he shoots a large block of ice.</i>] Ice! [<i>And then freezes the creatures head and quickly runs to the top. He stabs Magwood's head to obtain the jewels.</i>] [<i>Now walking away from the volcano, a frustrated Evergreen holds the jewels with Gunther slunk behind him.</i>]
</dd>,<dd><b>Evergreen</b>: <i>This</i> is why I don't teach you magic.
</dd>,<dd>[<i>Back at Evergreen's home</i>]
</dd>,<dd><b>Gunther</b>: [<i>Petting a sleeping Nina</i>] Niiina, Hiiina, Iiiina, Fiiina—
</dd>,<dd><b>Evergreen</b>: Gunther! The heck are you doing?! Get in here, Gunther! Oh, there you are, you blockhead. Quickly, take your position. We have precious little time. Once I complete the bonding chant, you deactivate the force field. [<i>Gunther gives a thumbs up.</i>] Bonding, bonding, three two one, you can do it, you can do it, three two one, bonding bonding. I did it! I— [<i>A pounding sound comes from the doors. An angry Magwood, now in igneous rock form, appears.

[<i>Dodging an attack Magwood breaks a column</i>] Watch the columns, stupid! Whoops! [<i>Although he runs to another part of the room he puts his hands up in defense.</i>] Easy now... [<i>Magwood rears up and stomps, the ceiling cracks and a large piece of it falls on its head, knocking it unconscious</i>] Oh, wow, did you see that?! [<i>Evergreen too is now pinned under a piece of ceiling.</i>] Ow, my bread balls!
</dd>,<dd>[<i>With the room in ruins, the floor falls away. Gunther is knocked unconscious only to wake with his master calling to him.</i>]
</dd>,<dd><b>Evergreen</b>: Gunther?! Gunther, can you hear me?!
</dd>,<dd><b>Gunther</b>: [<i>Groggily</i>] Yeah—yes, Master Evergreen!
</dd>,<dd><b>Evergreen</b>: Okay, good. Now, aiming at the sound of my voice, throw the crown so it lands right on the top of my head.
</dd>,<dd><b>Gunther</b>: I—wait, what?
</dd>,<dd><b>Evergreen</b>: No, no, there's no time! It must be you, Gunther!
</dd>,<dd><b>Gunther</b>: Me?
</dd>,<dd><b>Evergreen</b>: Don't worry, it's easy. Even a mush-head like you couldn't donk it up too bad. Just focus on your deepest truest wish, the destruction of the deadly comet, and the rest will take care of itself.
</dd>,<dd><b>Gunther</b>: [<i>Places the crown on his head</i>] My deepest truest wish... [<i>Darkness overtakes him</i>] Gunther, no! Gunther, no! Gunther, no!
</dd>,<dd><b>Evergreen</b>: Gunther? Buddy? What are you wishing for down there? [<i>Gunther sprouts white hair, a long nose and blue skin and starts shooting ice powers... all just like his master, Evergreen.

You've got to <b>snap out of it!</b> Use a concentration spell or, or a basic focusing charm—like I taught you... I mean, like I </i>meant<i> to teach you... I--</i>
</dd>,<dd><b>Gunther</b>: Gunther, no! Gunther, no! Gunther, no! Gunther, no! <i>Gunther, no!</i> <i><b>Gunther, no!</b></i>
</dd>,<dd>[<i>The comet approaches and all fades to neon green</i>]
</dd>,<dd>[<i>Morning. The Ice Kingdom in the present world of Ooo. Ice King, current wearer of the Crown, is seen jumping on his bed, dreaming the tragic events played out in the distant past.</i>]
</dd>,<dd><b>Ice King</b>: Gunther, no! Gunther, no! Gunther, no! <b>Gunther, noooooo!</b> [<i>Imitates explosion sounds - signaling the end of Evergreen's story - and falls off the bed and wakes up full, yawns</i>]. Mornin'. Man, what a dream. Do you guys ever have the dino-boy dream with the astero-- what? What... what is it? [<i>He sees the penguins shivering in the corner, afraid</i>] Something in my teeth? Something in my hair? Something in my nose? Something in my ear?
</dd>,<dd>[<i>As Ice King says the latter lines, the scene changes to the outside of the Ice Kingdom. In the morning sky, a twinkling new light - easily mistaken for a star - glints into view. A fade in to the depths of outer space reveals the source of the light: a new comet, light blue in color. Destination: Earth. Zoom in to the comet, fast approaching, then slowly and surely fade to black. And so the end begins again...</i>]

</dd>,<dd><b>Finn</b>: Wait, wait, wait, wait!
</dd>,<dd>[<i>Jake stretches Finn and himself on the Lich, and the guardian pulls them all out of the Time Room as if it were made of Jello. The guardian brings them towards <a href=""/wiki/Crystal_Citadel"" title=""Crystal Citadel"">the Citadel</a>. Jake looks back to the Time Room.</i>]
</dd>,<dd><b>Finn</b>: Look, Jake. [<i>Jake turns his head toward the Citadel</i>] More guardians. The Citadel, I presume.
</dd>,<dd><b>Jake</b>: Likely so.
</dd>,<dd><b>Finn</b>: Hey. Do you think maybe one of them could be my dad?
</dd>,<dd><b>Jake</b>: Eh, I don't think so. We'll probably know when we see him.
</dd>,<dd><b>Finn</b>: Right, right. That makes sense.
</dd>,<dd>[<i>They arrive at the Citadel. Jake turns into stairs that Finn walks down. The Lich is teleported to the floating crystal pillar on the top in front of where Finn and Jake can see him.</i>]
</dd>,<dd><b>Finn</b>: Hey! The Lich again! This must be where the prison cells be at. See? Good riddance, too. I hope you rot forever, you awful jerk-clapper. Some people just make the world a worse place to be in just by being around, Jake. [<i>The Lich starts to breathe gray smoke through the pink crystal.</i>] That's right. Bad apples. Lock 'em all up, I say. At the bottom of the ocean, where it's too dark to see.
</dd>,<dd>[<i>The camera view moves to a figure inside one of the crystal shards.</i>]
</dd>,<dd><b>Jake</b>: Look at that weird ol' kid over there. He looks just like you. [<i>It closes up on Finn's father.</i>] Man, look at his clo—
</dd>,<dd><b>Finn</b>: Daddyyy! [<i>Finn immediately jumps towards his father. Jake turns into a slide and slides Finn into the crystal cage with his father inside and falls onto the floor of the pillar</i>.] Aah! [<i>Jake and Finn look up at Finn's dad silently. The take then zooms in on Finn. Then it zooms in on his caged father</i>.] All locked up in there. D-Do you think maybe he's a criminal too?
</dd>,<dd><b>Jake</b>: [<i>He walks towards Finn who is still on the floor</i>.] Well, it had crossed my mind.
</dd>,<dd><b>Finn</b>: [<i>He groans while slapping his head across his face, then gets up from the floor.</i>] Jeez, man! Now I wish I hadn't said all that stuff before. Now my heart feels yellow and green. [<i>He makes an angry sound while clenching his fists in the air, then he exhales</i>.] Maybe we shouldn't even have come here—waah!? [<i>Jake is beside Finn's dad while blowing on it. Black fire is melting the crystal cells and pillars.</i>] Jake, what did you do?
</dd>,<dd><b>Jake</b>: It wasn't me! It came from up there!
</dd>,<dd>[<i>Finn looks up to see The Lich's crystal cell fully gray and spreading his grayness and black fire to other cells with prisoners that are gray and have escaped or are still in their cells. The prison is being destroyed by this. Finn is shocked by this</i>.]
</dd>,<dd><b>Finn</b>: [<i>referring to The Lich</i>] He's melting the crystal all up! [<i>It zooms in on the Lich than other prisoners as Finn talks.</i>] Breaking cats out left and right! Turning cats gray! Did he trick us <i>again</i>!? I think he <i>did</i>!
</dd>,<dd><b><a href=""/wiki/Martin"" title=""Martin"" class=""mw-redirect"">Martin</a></b>: Hey, kid! [<i>He starts to blow on the crystal that's burning on the crystal close to his hand.</i>] Hey, do me a favor. Get me out of here, huh? [<i>Finn, bearing his teeth, goes to help his father</i>.] This fire smells crazy!
</dd>,<dd>[<i>One of the escaped prisoners gets zapped in the background. Finn goes to Jake. Jake turns into a wrecking ball and twists him around his body then twists the other way to knock Jake into the crystal cell and saves his dad</i>.]
</dd>,<dd><b>Martin</b>: Thanks, kid. Now, where'd you guys park your Star Skipper? [<i>As Finn's dad speaks, the guardians fire off their lasers to obliterate the criminals trying to escape. One guardian has fallen in the line of duty and is falling into the depths of space</i>.] This place is coming down quick, and I mean quick, like <i>zip zip</i>. Like <i>wow</i>, like <i>boom boom wow</i>.
</dd>,<dd><b>Finn</b>: Oh. We... we don't have a Star Skipper.
</dd>,<dd><b>Jake</b>: [<i>turns back into his dog form</i>] Also, Finn'ss your son.
</dd>,<dd><b>Martin</b>: Whaaat? No Star Skipper?
</dd>,<dd><b>Jake</b>: Ahem! I said, Finn's your son. He came a long way to meet you.
</dd>,<dd><b>Martin</b>: Son? Oh, hey, good for you, kid. In other news, I still gotta get out of here and the ground is melting. Huh? [<i>He pokes at a pink circle that has formed in the center of the Citadel.</i>] It's all pooling in the center.
</dd>,<dd><b>Finn</b>: Hey, um... I... I wanted to ask you something. I... well... [<i>Finn's dad jumps into the center.</i>] Hey, wait up! [<i>Jake brings himself and Finn into the center. They all swim upwards.</i>] [<i>underwater</i>] Dad, wait! [<i>At the top of the center, Finn, Martin and Jake gasp for air. Limbs of the guardians are everywhere. A guardian falls and makes a wave.</i>] Dad, I need to ask you —- aah! [<i>The wave causes Finn, Jake, and Martin to a rock of the Citadel that is standing as an island. They all catch their breathe. Jake coughs up water.</i>]
</dd>,<dd><b>Jake</b>: [<i>coughs</i>] [<i>gasps</i>]
</dd>,<dd>[<i>All the prisoners are loose and most of them are fighting one another.

</dd>,<dd><b>Jake</b>: [<i>looks around</i>] Finn, I know we normally come out of these things okay, but I got a bad feeling about this. Just promise me, if both my eyes get fried off, you'll fry yours off too.
</dd>,<dd>[<i>Jake stretches his arms and pulls Finn out of the water</i>.]
</dd>,<dd><b>Finn</b>: What? No. [<i>He gets up from the floor</i>] Listen, you don't gotta worry about a thing, Jake ol' pal. [<i>He points upwards</i>] We just need to defeat those five space villains, hijack the shard they're hijacking and sail it home to safety. [<i>Jake looks upwards.</i>] Easy peasy.
</dd>,<dd><b>Martin</b>: Yeah, Jake, smarten up. As soon as the last guardian dies, the fighting stops. See? He's bitin' the dust right now.
</dd>,<dd>[<i>A guardian is dying with black flames on its head. It shoots a parting laser before it fully bites the dust and it burns off Martin's lower leg, exposing the bone underneath.</i> Brutal.]
</dd>,<dd><b>Finn</b>: Aahh! Uh oh! [<i>he says it 15 times</i>]
</dd>,<dd>[<i>While Finn is speaking, Martin falls over. Jake crouches over holds his head and breathes.</i>]
</dd>,<dd><b>Martin</b>: It's-- It's okay. It's okay. [<i>Finn continues then stops.</i>] You just gotta fetch me a gob of that guardian blood, son. It's got that good nooch that keeps us young in the crystal.
</dd>,<dd><b>Finn</b>: Nooch?
</dd>,<dd><b>Martin</b>: Come on now, partner. [<i>breath</i>] No dawdling, yer old man needs ya. [<i>winks</i>]
</dd>,<dd><b>Finn</b>: [<i>sighs</i>]
</dd>,<dd>[<i>Jake has stretched to form a bridge between two islands. Finn walks across.</i>]
</dd>,<dd><b>Martin</b>: Atta boy, Flynn! Do it for yer old man! Yeah, yeah, just get right in there! Don't be shy. Yeah!
</dd>,<dd>[<i>Finn reaches the other side. He plunges his hands into the gooey white substance. He manages to pull a large blob from the mass and falls over backwards into the water. He hurries back over.</i>]
</dd>,<dd><b>Martin</b>: Hey, good job, son! Now, rub some of that sap on my leg there. Make sure to get it into the chicken wing hole.
</dd>,<dd><b>Finn</b>: [<i>shudders</i>] Dad...
</dd>,<dd><b>Martin</b>: Martin!
</dd>,<dd><b>Finn</b>: Okay, M-Martin. We need to talk.
</dd>,<dd><b>Martin</b>: Yeah, okay, kid, but hurry it up. I'm trying to act cool here, but this thing <i>really</i> stings!
</dd>,<dd><b>Finn</b>: [<i>inhales, talks speedily</i>] <i><b>Why'd you abandon me in the forest when I was a little baby!?</b></i>
</dd>,<dd><b>Martin</b>: Oh... I mean... Heh. You know me. I'm a <i>funny guy</i>!
</dd>,<dd><b>Finn</b>: [<i>groans unhappily</i>]
</dd>,<dd><b>Martin</b>: Ahhh, I dunno. It was a long time ago. [<i>Martin brushes his hair back while he talks</i>] Who knows, [<i>points at Finn</i>] maybe <i>you</i> left <i>me!</i>
</dd>,<dd>[<i>Holding the sap, Finn looks unhappy. Jake looks angry towards Martin.</i>]
</dd>,<dd><b>Martin</b>: [sighs] But hey, daddy's back! [grunts] [<i>Martin scoots over to Finn and put his arm around him.</i>] You and me, daddy and baby, or should I say...baby and daddy. [<i>He lightly slaps his face. He then moves his leg closer to Finn.</i>] Now slap that sap! [<i>Finn takes some of the sap and spreads it on his leg bone. This renews his veins, muscle, then his skin.</i>] Whoa! Would ya look at that! [<i>He brings his leg near his face.</i>] Smooth like new. [<i>He holds his boot.</i>] Pssh, couldn't fix the boot too, huh?
</dd>,<dd><b>Jake</b>: Dude!! [<i>Jake grabs at Finn's shirt.</i>] S'mores important junk happening! Look!
</dd>,<dd>[<i>Black fire is bubbling the melted sea-like crystal. The crystal that was holding the Lich has turned from pink to gray pops up from the melted crystal. The camera goes to Finn and Jake. Jake runs across the scene.</i>]
</dd>,<dd><b>Finn</b>: It's time to peel bananas on this fool, as a family! [<i>In unison, Jake and Finn flex their muscles.</i>] How about it, Martin? [<i>beat</i>] Dad?
</dd>,<dd><b>Martin</b>: [<i>Swimming away from the island Finn and Jake are at.</i>] I gotta run to the store!
</dd>,<dd><b>Finn</b>: [<i>annoyed</i>] Hrm. [<i>An explosion throws Finn off balance. He turns around.</i>] Wha?
</dd>,<dd>[<i>The Lich is standing and surrounded by black fire. He takes a step. The only part of Billy that is still attached to him is his eye. Billy's eye slides off the Lich. He turns the surrounding area fully black.</i>]
</dd>,<dd><b>The Lich</b>: <i><b>Fall.</b></i>
</dd>,<dd>[<i>Finn and Jake are forced to the floor. The Lich walks toward Finn. The Lich laughs menacingly. Finn finds the strength to get on his legs and knees. He looks towards Jake, who can't get up</i>.]
</dd>,<dd><b>The Lich</b>: You are alone, child. [<i>Finn falls and lets out a groan. There is a light now in the dark coming from the small crystal island that Finn and Jake lie on.</i>] There is only darkness for you, and only <b>death</b> for your people. [<i>The Lich points to the shard with crystal and criminals on it.</i>] These Ancients are just the beginning.
</dd>,<dd>[<i>As the Lich talks, He walks over to Finn and Finn is trying to attack. Weakly, he gets his sword out and falls over while groaning. He falls in the guardian blood.</i>]
</dd>,<dd><b>The Lich</b>: I will command a great and terrible army; and we will sail to a billion worlds. We will sail until every light has been extinguished. You are strong, child. But I am <i>beyond</i> strength. I am <i><b>the end</b></i>. [<i>He reaches to touch Finn. Finn rolls to see the Lich. He balls his hand in a fist.</i>] And I have come for <i>you</i>, Finn. [<i>Finn slaps the Lich with the blood on his hand. The Lich starts to grow veins and muscle. This causes the blackness to go away. The Lich starts to spazz and make bizarre noises as he is tainted by what he is the opposite of:</i> Life. <i>Everyone who was under his spell aren't anymore.</i>]
</dd>,<dd><b>Finn</b>: [<i>Finn sits up.</i>] What? You don't like this stuff, huh? [<i>He reaches for more guardian blood.</i>] Whoa! [<i>His transformation goes faster and Jake wakes up. He falls over, now made of flesh.</i>] Right in the doorbell. [<i>He looks toward his dad.</i>] Dad. [<i>He runs toward him.</i>] Jake, finish off the Lich. I gotta go catch my dad.
</dd>,<dd><b>Jake</b>: Finn, forget that loser!
</dd>,<dd>[<i>Finn dives in the crystal-like sea and swims to his dad. Martin is humming to himself and is climbing up the shard.</i>]
</dd>,<dd><b>Finn</b>: Dad, wait!
</dd>,<dd>[<i>Finn starts coming up to the shard. Martin glances back to see him, then goes back to climbing. He gets to the top.</i>]
</dd>,<dd><b>Martin</b>: Hey, cool guys. Looking for a new boss? [<i>They look at him and then he winks at them. As Finn climbs up the shard, one of the criminals, a centipede, starts to cut at the shard Finn is climbing up.</i>] Chew faster, that guy's really moving.
</dd>,<dd>[<i>The centipede cuts the shard before Finn makes it. He grabs both shard pieces and tries to pull them back together. He seems to be losing his grip.</i>]
</dd>,<dd><b>Finn</b>: [<i>grunting and disappointed</i>] Dad! Stop!
</dd>,<dd><b>Jake</b>: [<i>He glances over at the Lich, then he sees Finn in danger.</i>] Finn! [<i>He takes an arm and throws it to help Finn.</i>]
</dd>,<dd>[<i>Finn has almost lost his grip. Jake pulls him to help keep it together.</i>]
</dd>,<dd><b>Finn</b>: [<i>shouting</i>] Martin, I won't let you escape!
</dd>,<dd><b>Martin</b>: [<i>Martin runs toward a Void Caster</i>] Hey, hey, you're a void caster, right? We gotta put some [<i>pats his leg</i>] gas in this buggy.
</dd>,<dd>[<i>The Void Caster nods his head. He opens a void and it pulls the crystal toward another dimension.</i>]
</dd>,<dd><b>Jake</b>: Finn! Let go! He's not worth it!
</dd>,<dd>[<i>Finn is still struggling to keep hold, and his face gets more red the more effort he puts into keeping hold. The grass sword on Finn's arm forms into a large, grassy, spiny arm which grows bigger and bursts his clothes off as he screams. Jake gasps. The grass arm now intertwines with the shard.</i>]
</dd>,<dd><b>Martin</b>: Oh, gross. Pedal to the metal!
</dd>,<dd>[<i>The Void Caster makes the void larger. The strength of the other void causes Finn's grass arm to snap off, thus taking his forearm along with it. Jake gasps. Finn falls into the ocean. The crystal and other half of the shard go into the void.</i>]
</dd>,<dd><b>Martin</b>: Hey, what about air—?
</dd>,<dd>[<i>While Finn is in the ocean, a small bit of the guardians' blood touches his arm and makes a flower. Jake pulls Finn in from the ocean and onto the small island. Jake moves Finn's hair out of his face and sits him up.</i>]
</dd>,<dd><b>Jake</b>: It'll be okay, dude.
</dd>,<dd>[<i><a href=""/wiki/Shelby"" title=""Shelby"">Shelby</a> comes out of Jake's ear and tears up. He lies on Finn's arm. Finn smiles. He grimaces at his arm.</i>]
</dd>,<dd><b>Finn</b>: [<i>sighs</i>] I mean, at least you finished off the Lich, right?
</dd>,<dd>[<i>Jake perks up.</i>]
</dd>,<dd><b>Jake</b>: Oh, yeah, that's the good news: I didn't <i>have</i> to! One sec. [<i>He runs behind the large piece of crystal.</i>] Up you go! Check this out! [<i>Finn is surprised, Jake shows Finn the</i> new <i>Lich. And so this is how the undead scourge ends.</i>] Brand new baby. The Lich is super cute now, and he smells real neat! [<i>The new Lich sticks out his tongue.</i>] That sap rebooted him or something. [<i>The Lich makes popping sounds with his mouth.</i>] I like him a lot.
</dd>,<dd>[<i>Finn smiles. A train whistles.</i>]

Don't Look/Transcript ,"<dd><b>Jake</b>: Hmm. [<i>Reading aloud</i>] 'Make more friends with sing-talking.' ♪ ♪ Hey there Finn! Whatcha reading? ♪ ♪
</dd>,<dd><b>Finn</b>: It's a manuscript about ""The Legend of Dead Mountain."" Supposedly, if you get to the top, there's a treasure that will change you into the person you always wanted to be.
</dd>,<dd><b>Jake</b>: That's a dumb story; I love dumb stories! What would you change about yourself if you got that treasure? Fix your weird cursed grass arm so it wouldn't be weird and cursed?
</dd>,<dd><b>Finn</b>: Nah. I'd like to be taller.
</dd>,<dd><b>Jake</b>: How tall we talking about?
</dd>,<dd><b>Finn</b>: I don't know. Like a couple of inches. Say as tall as Princess Bubblegum?
</dd>,<dd><b>Jake</b>: [<i>Mockingly</i>] Oh I see.
</dd>,<dd><b>Finn</b>: Jake, how would you change yourself on Dead Mountain if only the legends were true?
</dd>,<dd><b>Jake</b>: [<i>Leaning back</i>] I wouldn't change anything; I'm the whole package. [<i>Falls backward</i>] Whoa!
</dd>,<dd><b>Finn</b>: [<i>Looks through book</i>] Hey! There's a big warning about Dead Mountain in here. See? [<i>Shows book</i>] It says some kind of evil hermit guards the mountaintop. [<i>Reading aloud</i>] 'Don't let him look at you or something horrible will happen.' That seals the deal. The twin temptations of getting to grow a couple of inches and battling an evil hermit sound like a pretty perfect day. Let's go!
</dd>,<dd><b>Turtle Princess</b>: Shh!
</dd>,<dd><b>Finn</b>: [<i>Whispering</i>] Let's go.
</dd>,<dd>[<i>Finn and Jake march up Death Mountain</i>]
</dd>,<dd><b>Finn and Jake</b>: [<i>Chanting</i>] Gear up for battle! You smell like cattle! Gear up for battle! You smell... Like cattle!
</dd>,<dd><b>Finn</b>: Monsters that get you by looking at you are so doomb.
</dd>,<dd><b>Jake</b>: Everybody knows all you need is a mirror.
</dd>,<dd><b>Finn</b>: They ought to get a new gimmick. [<i>Finn and Jake reach the top</i>] There's the evil hermit's uh... what is that? A hut?
</dd>,<dd><b>Jake</b>: No it's a yurt.
</dd>,<dd>[<i>Finn and Jake enter the yurt, scaring away the rats inside</i>]
</dd>,<dd><b>Finn and Jake</b>: Yah! Rats!
</dd>,<dd><b>Finn</b>: [<i>Confused</i>] Is <i>that</i> the hermit? [<i>Disappointed</i>] We don't get to fight the hermit.
</dd>,<dd><b>Jake</b>: Hey look.
</dd>,<dd><b>Finn</b>: What is it boy?
</dd>,<dd><b>Jake</b>: The treasure. Okay here it goes. [<i>Shakes snow globe</i>] Oh great treasure, make my taste buds think they're tasting fried chicken even when I eat my fruits and vegetables. I don't have any fruits or vegetables on me. I guess we'll find out later if that worked. Your turn.
</dd>,<dd><b>Finn</b>: [<i>Speaking to globe</i>] Oh great treasure, I want to be approximately 11.5 inches taller. [<i>Stares at globe</i>] Gross! It's leaking! [<i>Finn and Jake inspect the yurt</i>] This place is depressing.
</dd>,<dd><b>Jake</b>: And I'm not growing taller.
</dd>,<dd><b>Finn</b>: There's nothing going on here. ON TOP OF DEAD MOUNTAIN!
</dd>,<dd><b>Jake</b>: We should have known better than to trust a book.
</dd>,<dd>[<i>Finn hands Jake back the snow globe</i>]
</dd>,<dd><b>Finn</b>: Yeah. He makes one cool skeleton though. [<i>Walks up to Hermit</i>] These shades... [<i>Takes off sunglasses</i>] Let me check out these shades. [<i>Hermit's eyes shine brightly at Finn</i>] Aah! Ohh!
</dd>,<dd><b>Jake</b>: Finn!
</dd>,<dd>[<i>Finn wakes up in his bed disoriented</i>]
</dd>,<dd><b>Finn</b>: Huh? Jake?
</dd>,<dd><b>Jake</b>: You're awake! Oh I was so worried. I've been waiting with a bowl of soup. It has hoops and loops and maybe some goop.
</dd>,<dd><b>Finn</b>: [<i>Fatigued</i>] What happened? I don't remember getting into bed.
</dd>,<dd><b>Jake</b>: Don't worry. You're gonna be fine... [<i>Looks away</i>] in no time.
</dd>,<dd><b>Finn</b>: Thanks for taking care of me. You're the greatest big brother ever. [<i>Jakes transforms into a ""jock""</i>] W-Why are you doing that?
</dd>,<dd><b>Jake</b>: I'm not.
</dd>,<dd>[<i>BMO enters the room</i>]
</dd>,<dd><b>BMO</b>: You're awake! You want some tea? Or saltine crackers?
</dd>,<dd><b>Finn</b>: BMO, you're my little angel.

</dd>,<dd><b>BMO</b>: I'm a real boy! [<i>Wings sprout from his back</i>] With wings! [<i>Halo manifests above his head</i>] And a halo! [<i>BMO flies out the window laughing gleefully</i>] Oh!
</dd>,<dd><b>Finn</b>: What's happening?
</dd>,<dd><b>Jake</b>: I don't know but it probably has something to do with your weird old eyes.
</dd>,<dd><b>Finn</b>: [<i>Surprised</i>] Something is wrong with my eyes?
</dd>,<dd>[<i>Finn jumps out of bed and runs to the mirror</i>]
</dd>,<dd><b>Finn</b>: Aah! Hermit eyes! Dead-hermit eyes!
</dd>,<dd><b>Jake</b>: Heh, it's fine.
</dd>,<dd><b>Finn</b>: Do you think the hermit did this... to punish me for grabbing his shades?
</dd>,<dd><b>Jake</b>: I think maybe the eyes <i>are</i> the treasure.
</dd>,<dd><b>Finn</b>: So, then, am I making people what they want to be?
</dd>,<dd><b>Jake</b>: No, because I don't want to be this awesome sweater bro. But maybe that's how you see me.
</dd>,<dd>[<i>Shelby squirms out from the fruit on the table</i>]

</dd>,<dd><b>Finn</b>: Is this what you needed help with?
</dd>,<dd><b>Princess Bubblegum</b>: No I think I got this. Oh! Hi Finn and Jake. You guys look... Cool. You trying out a new look?

</dd>,<dd><b>Finn</b>: Aah! Did I kill Neptr?!
</dd>,<dd><b>Jake</b>: You turned him into a microwave. So...Yeah you kind of did.
</dd>,<dd><b>Finn</b>: But... but... but that's not how I see Neptr is it? I like Neptr. He's like my half-son. If I was a better person would I be turning my friends into better things? Am I uncaring judgmental...
</dd>,<dd>[<i>Finn transforms into a caricature of his father</i>]

</dd>,<dd><b>Jake</b>: Finn! You're being melodramatic!

</dd>,<dd><b>Finn</b>: I know it's you.
</dd>,<dd><b>Jake</b>: Hey buddy I figured you'd come back here.
</dd>,<dd><b>Finn</b>: Don't look at me Jake. I might turn you into a microwave.
</dd>,<dd><b>Jake</b>: Baloney! You turned Neptr into a microwave because he's a microwave. But that doesn't mean that's <i>all</i> he is to you. I know you think Neptr is an interesting person and I know that ""microwave"" is just one part of his personality. I mean maybe your eyes are just bad at describing things you know? Like how you feel about people what they mean to you... That stuff's in your guts. Eyes can't grok that... Unless you have the eyes of like a trained artist or something. But you don't. I'm telling you man you're not a bad dude like this skeleton bro or you'd be turning everyone into rats and plops. Now come on. Look at me.
</dd>,<dd><b>Finn</b>: Jake you're so wise.
</dd>,<dd>[<i>Jakes transforms into a small old elf</i>]
</dd>,<dd><b>Jake</b>: What?! Well at least you're listening to me. And wise old jakey got a plan. [<i>Back at the Tree Fort Finn is looking at his reflection</i>] P.B., you want to go first?
</dd>,<dd><b>Princess Bubblegum</b>: He may not be the most cunning soldier but one thing about Finn is that he always puts other people first and that makes him a true hero.
</dd>,<dd>[<i>Finn transforms in a Spartan soldier and then back to his caricature but wearing Spartan armor</i>]

</dd>,<dd><b>Jake</b>: Finn's just the best guy to do bro stuff with like lying on the grass and talking to bugs or baking chocolate chip cookies. Finn's just a good friend.
</dd>,<dd>[<i>Finn transforms back to his self with the hermit eyes</i>]
</dd>,<dd><b>Finn</b>: I'm me again. These balls are going nuts. [<i>The hermit's eyes pop-out of Finn and Finn puts the eyes into the microwave</i>] Uh... My son.

</dd>,<dd><b>Tiffany</b>: He'll need a shoulder to cry whiny, Finn-style tears on, and that shoulder will be mine—Tiffany's! Then I can get busy with undoing your cheesy influence, plus more! With my help, Jake will become the criminal juggernaut he was always meant to be.
</dd>,<dd>[<i>In Tiffany's imagination, a giant Jake roars and beats his chest over a city, while helicopters with searchlights hover nearby.</i>]
</dd>,<dd><b>Tiffany</b>: We won't just be robbing banks anymore.
</dd>,<dd>[<i>Jake grabs hold of two buildings and rips them off their foundations.</i>]
</dd>,<dd><b>Tiffany</b>: We'll be robbing the actual banks. The whole banks!
</dd>,<dd>[<i>Jake swallows the buildings.</i>]
</dd>,<dd><b>Tiffany</b>: You get it? We're gonna steal actual whole buildings.
</dd>,<dd><b>Finn</b>: Yeah, I get it.
</dd>,<dd><b>Tiffany</b>: So don't tell me we're not so different, okay?! We're opposites, you and me. Oil and goody-goody snow-white baby-vanilla bean mitten water! Go, Tiffany! [<i>runs off</i>]
</dd>,<dd><b>Finn</b>: [<i>unsheathes sword</i>] Man, that nut's gonna try and stick me while I'm not even looking. [<i>sees his reflection in the sword's gem</i>] Don't even stress it, Finn. You're Finn Mertens, man. You got this. [<i>sighs</i>] Man, I hope so.
</dd>,<dd><b>Tiffany</b>: Finn! Get in here, quick!
</dd>,<dd>[<i>Finn catches up with Tiffany.</i>]
</dd>,<dd><b>Finn</b>: The junction.
</dd>,<dd><b>Tiffany</b>: There's something moving in the walls. It was like [<i>imitates sound</i>].
</dd>,<dd>[<i>Suddenly, the walls rumble, and three giant worms break through, roaring.</i>]
</dd>,<dd><b>Finn</b>: Wall worms! Holy cow!
</dd>,<dd>[<i>Tiffany prepares to stab Finn in the back with a dagger. Finn turns around.</i>]
</dd>,<dd><b>Finn</b>: Dang it, Tiffany, not yet! We got to work together to beat the worms! Here they come!
</dd>,<dd>[<i>Finn slices off one worm's head, while Tiffany punches and kicks another. The third worm comes up behind Tiffany and prepares to lunge.</i>]
</dd>,<dd><b>Finn</b>: Tiffany!
</dd>,<dd>[<i>Tiffany turns and shields himself with his arms. Finn throws his sword into the worm's head. It falls on the road with a thud. Finn retrieves his sword and smiles at Tiffany. More growling is heard.</i>]
</dd>,<dd><b>Finn &amp; Tiffany</b>: Oh, snap! Look out! They're coming in from the side!
</dd>,<dd>[<i>Finn and Tiffany each jump on a different worm. Finn runs up its back to reach its head while dodging worms breaking through the walls and lunging at him. Finn glances over at Tiffany doing the same. The two reach their worm's head at the same time, and Finn stabs Tiffany's worm in the head. Simultaneously, Tiffany punches Finn's worm. The two worms fall. Finn and Tiffany land back on the road.</i>]
</dd>,<dd><b>Tiffany</b>: You good?
</dd>,<dd><b>Finn</b>: My tooth hurts.
</dd>,<dd>[<i>Another worm lunges at Finn from behind. Tiffany grabs Finn, and they duck as it passes overhead. It turns around and prepares another attack. Finn and Tiffany exchange looks and nod. Finn leaps off the road as Tiffany grabs his feet, letting Finn slice the worm down the middle. The two continue battling worms as a team. Afterwards, the two rest while panting heavily, thinking it's over. However, one last worm, the biggest of them all, emerges from the floor.</i>]
</dd>,<dd><b>Finn</b>: Dang! It's the head worm, and she's livid! I say we get the heck out of heeeeere—!
</dd>,<dd>[<i>The road crumbles beneath him, and as he falls, he smacks his head on the ledge.</i>]
</dd>,<dd><b>Tiffany</b>: Finn!
</dd>,<dd><b>Finn</b>: [<i>hanging on to the ledge</i>] Tiffany, quick! Pull me up! Quick, Tiffany! I'm slipping!
</dd>,<dd>[<i>Tiffany slowly takes out his dagger.</i>]
</dd>,<dd><b>Finn</b>: Dang it, Tiffany! Weren't you paying attention? We're two peas in a pod! We're not oil and water. We're oil and vinegar! It's good, man. It's yummy!
</dd>,<dd><b>Tiffany</b>: Mm...
</dd>,<dd><b>Finn</b>: It's good for you!
</dd>,<dd><b>Tiffany</b>: [<i>sighs</i>] You're right, Finn. I can't bring myself to do it...
</dd>,<dd>[<i>Finn smiles.</i>]
</dd>,<dd><b>Tiffany</b>: ...but I can't bring myself to save you, either.
</dd>,<dd>[<i>Finn is still smiling.</i>]
</dd>,<dd><b>Tiffany</b>: Why are you still smiling?
</dd>,<dd><b>Finn</b>: Sorry. I didn't hear what you said. I was just gonna let it slide.
</dd>,<dd><b>Tiffany</b>: Look, you're—you're on your own. I'm sorry.
</dd>,<dd>[<i>Finn's smile vanishes.</i>]
</dd>,<dd><b>Tiffany</b>: Catch you on the flip, I guess.
</dd>,<dd><b>Finn</b>: Tiffany? [<i>His hand slips</i>] Tiffa— [<i>falling</i>] nooooooooo!
</dd>,<dd>[<i>Finn falls into the worm's open mouth and lands on its palate. The worm coughs and gags Finn back out with such force that he smashes his head against a stalactite, shattering all his teeth. Finn falls on Tiffany, pushing him into the worm's mouth.</i>]
</dd>,<dd><b>Tiffany</b>: [<i>screams</i>]
</dd>,<dd>[<i>The worm snaps its mouth shut. When Finn opens his eyes, he is back in the Ant Nation.</i>]
</dd>,<dd><b>General Tarsal</b>: Whoa! Easy, son. Don't try to speak. Your mouth is full of ants.
</dd>,<dd><b>Finn</b>: Huh?
</dd>,<dd>[<i>The ants start leaving Finn's mouth.</i>]
</dd>,<dd><b>Ant</b>: It's okay. We just finished up.
</dd>,<dd><b>Finn</b>: Ah. [<i>smacks lips</i>] What happened down there? Where's Tiffany?
</dd>,<dd><b>General Tarsal</b>: Well, the good news is the worm queen was defeated, choked to death on some foreign object, presumably Cadet Tiffany, who is missing in action, which is the bad news.
</dd>,<dd><b>Finn</b>: Tiffany...
</dd>,<dd><b>General Tarsal</b>: But we didn't have to fix his teeth, which is nice news. But we did have to fix your teeth, which is okay news.
</dd>,<dd><b>Finn</b>: [<i>biting</i>] Huh huh. Ayyyy!
</dd>,<dd><b>General Tarsal</b>: So, on behalf of the ant nation, I'd like to thank you for your service, which is now concluded. As soon as you're ready, we'll get you stuffed back up that well with all the snakes and butter.
</dd>,<dd>[<i>Finn reaches the top of the well.</i>]
</dd>,<dd><b>Finn</b>: Holy cow.
</dd>,<dd>[<i>Everyone cheers at his arrival. A banner reads, ""Welcome home Finn!"" and Princess Bubblegum showers him with confetti.</i>]
</dd>,<dd><b>Princess Bubblegum</b>: Welcome home, Finn.
</dd>,<dd><b>Jake</b>: Yeah. Welcome home, buddy.
</dd>,<dd><b>Finn</b>: Thanks, you guys! Man, you'll never believe it. Dentist is actually—

We can't all be a cute, little character with a cure, little straw sticking out of our cute, little head.But take some advice from an old grave digger, huh? Maybe it's time to do something with <i>that</i>. Here a thought... I could bury this for you. An unmarked grave kind of thing. Just... sswt!... Toss him in there with whoever.
</dd>,<dd><b>Chery Cream Soda</b>: Well, that's... that seems macabre. But sweet. I'll think about it.

</dd>,<dd><b>Dirt Beer Guy</b>: Honey, I'm fairly upset that you remarried.
</dd>,<dd><b>Chery Cream Soda</b>: But how is ths possible? You were zapped by Darren, the ancient sleeper. Your dome was cracked. Your root beer soaked into the ground.

Checkmate/Transcript ,"<dd><b>Peppermint Butler</b>: [<i>thinking</i>] Evil is rising. In vile power, the fiend walks among us again. The Vampire King.

</dd>,<dd><b>Peppermint Butler</b>: Wait! Uh... how's it going?
</dd>,<dd><b>Jake</b>: It's good, you know? Uh, Marceline's got all her powers back. She's getting ready to give the Vampire King a big, fat whompin', uh, I hope.
</dd>,<dd><b>Peppermint Butler</b>: Um, while that's going down, do you think you could ask the V.K. to sign something for me?

</dd>,<dd><b>Princess Bubblegum</b>: [<i>stops doing jumping jacks</i>] You think I'm nice? Oh, brains! I lost count.
</dd>,<dd><b>Marceline</b>: That's okay. I'm done with bat jacks. [<i>sighs</i>] I have this weird feeling in my tums.

</dd>,<dd><b>Princess Bubblegum</b>: Later, we can, all the time. But, for now-now, we got to get our plan together.
</dd>,<dd><b>Marceline</b>: [<i>eats an apple</i>] Easy. First, we take down the V.K, kill him, destroy him, and...kill him! [<i>continues eating the apple</i>]
</dd>,<dd><b>Jake</b>: I like this plan! It's got good bones!

</dd>,<dd><b>Jake</b>: Oh really! Why don't you step inside for a nice chat? [<i>runs at the VK in the shape of a spike closet with stakes for spikes</i>]

</dd>,<dd><i>[Marceline hisses and turns invisible, going at the Vampire King with a still-visible stake. He sees the stake and stops her, crushing the stake with his powers.]</i>

</dd>,<dd><b>Vampire King</b>: Will you calm down and listen to-
</dd>,<dd><b>Finn</b>: YAHHH! [<i>Finn runs at the Vampire King with the huge stake he was crafting before. He throws it and it falls short of the Vampire King by several feet</i>]

</dd>,<dd><b>Princess Bubblegum</b>: [<i>to Marceline, who heals the stake out of her arm</i>] Sorry.

</dd>,<dd><b>Finn</b>: Roll out! [<i>somersaults away, grabbing a stake</i>] Thorn arm! [<i>outstretching his grass arm</i>] ACTIVATE!
</dd>,<dd>[<i>Nothing happens.</i>]
</dd>,<dd><b>Finn</b>: [<i>to his arm</i>] You gonna help, or what?
</dd>,<dd><b>Vampire King</b>: [<i>throws bit of stake at Finn's face and walks up to him</i>] Let me finish my thought.
</dd>,<dd><b>Finn</b>: [<i>raising his own stake up at the V.K.</i>] Stake you! [<i>The Vampire King grabs Finn's wrist</i>] Okay, go ahead.
</dd>,<dd><b>Vampire King</b>: This is the old way. Agents of darkness and light in a tug-of-war. But now, a creature can step out of that struggle. In this age, why would I want to be the Vampire King anymore?
</dd>,<dd><b>Princess Bubblegum</b>: [<i>coldly</i>] I don't know, why would you?
</dd>,<dd><b>Vampire King</b>: I wouldn't. I submit. [<i>kneeling down, placing hands behind back</i>] Take the vampire essence from my blood. Free me from the shackles of my station.

</dd>,<dd><b>Vampire King</b>: How many times do you wanna do this, Marceline? Our lives have magnetized. We're in a negative loop. [<i>Marceline turns into a bat and goes after him</i>] But we can change our outcome this time!
</dd>,<dd><b>Marceline</b>: I like the outcome where you get staked!
</dd>,<dd><b>Vampire King</b>: And you become a vampire?
</dd>,<dd>[<i>Marcy snarls, but changes back into her regular form.</i>]
</dd>,<dd><b>Vampire King</b>: Marceline. [<i>she punches him</i>] I know I was ruthless in the past. But tell me, what's the one thing you've noticed about the world, since you beat me all those hundreds of years ago?
</dd>,<dd><b>Marceline</b>: Everything repeats over and over again. No one learns anything, 'cause no one lives long enough to see the pattern, I guess.
</dd>,<dd><b>Vampire King</b>: But you've lived long enough.
</dd>,<dd><b>Marceline</b>: I know. Duh.
</dd>,<dd><b>Vampire King</b>: And you still think this is the right way? Fighting me?
</dd>,<dd><b>Marceline</b>: The other way's like a black hole; an unknown.
</dd>,<dd><b>Vampire King</b>: So let's consult a witch-
</dd>,<dd><b>Marceline</b>: [<i>punching him back and taking out a stake</i>] No witches.
</dd>,<dd>[<i>where the King flew back, the clouds part, revealing the Vampire King sitting in a cloud of water and vocalizing</i>]
</dd>,<dd><b>Vampire King</b>: [<i>rips off his shirt</i>] I'm not afraid of the unknown! [<i>pounds chest</i>] I have the power- [<i>spins a pillar of water around, standing on it, as lightning flashes behind him</i>] -to change destiny! Queen of vampires! You weigh the scales of fate. Spill my guts, or face the unknown. Either way, I will not bite. For turning you would subjugate me to the wheel of fortune. And I am a king, not a hamster. My path runs straight into the void, on a sick, flaming chariot! [<i>strikes the water and it splashes all the way to the ground, where Jake, Finn, and PB gasp</i>] Stake me. I will not hide. [<i>rips off his pants as lightning strikes again</i>] Do it, chicken! You make me sick! [<i>goes back to the puddle of water in the cloud and splashes around and yells like a maniac.</i>]
</dd>,<dd><b>Marceline</b>: Okay, dag! We'll take your stupid thing out!
</dd>,<dd><b>Vampire King</b>: [<i>stops splashing and yelling</i>] My what?
</dd>,<dd><b>Marceline</b>: Your dang vamp juice, come on!

</dd>,<dd><b>Princess Bubblegum</b>: No funny business us, or you?
</dd>,<dd><b>Marceline</b>: Him.
</dd>,<dd><b>Jake</b>: [<i>to Vampire King</i>] What happened to your pants?
</dd>,<dd><b>Jake</b>: Hold that thought! [<i>As Finn is about to land from when he was launched, Jake stretches into a big pillow and catches him.</i>]
</dd>,<dd><b>Finn</b>: [<i>bounces off Jake and runs over to kick the Vampire King in the groin</i>] Finish him! Bam bam bam bam bam bam bam-
</dd>,<dd><b>Marceline</b>: Finn, you can stop.
</dd>,<dd><b>Finn</b>: Oh, okay, now we're stopping. [<i>to Vampire King</i>] Sorry, dude.
</dd>,<dd><b>Vampire King</b>: [<i>in high-pitched voice</i>] It's chill. [<i>to Marceline</i>] See? No funny business.
</dd>,<dd>[<i>the scene cuts to the group walking up the hill to Gumbald's cabin.</i>]
</dd>,<dd><b>Finn</b>: [<i>whispering</i>] Hey, Jake.
</dd>,<dd><b>Jake</b>: [<i>turning around</i>] What?

</dd>,<dd><b>Peppermint Butler</b>: Be cool. Be like, 'How's it going, VK? I'm Peppermint B and I know all about you!' No, that sounds lame. 'Yo, V.K., sign my book, jerk!' No...
</dd>,<dd><b>Princess Bubblegum</b>: [<i>opens door</i>] We're home!
</dd>,<dd>[<i>Peppbut gasps as everyone walks in</i>]
</dd>,<dd><b>Princess Bubblegum</b>: Is the lab ready?
</dd>,<dd><b>Peppermint Butler</b>: [<i>nervously</i>] Of course. Is he here? [<i>gasps</i>]
</dd>,<dd><b>Vampire King</b>: [<i>enters, holding his cow</i>] Hey.
</dd>,<dd><b>Peppermint Butler</b>: [<i>screaming internally</i>] AAHHH! SAY SOMETHING; ASK HIM TO SIGN THE BOOK!
</dd>,<dd><b>Vampire King</b>: [<i>staring at the silent candy person and shrugging</i>] Meh. [<i>walks towards the lab</i>]
</dd>,<dd><b>Peppermint Butler</b>: [<i>still silently screaming to himself</i>] DO IT, HE'S GETTING AWAY! [<i>runs after him</i>]
</dd>,<dd>[<i>scene changes to basement, where the Vampire King is getting strapped into PB's extraction machine</i>]
</dd>,<dd><b>Peppermint Butler</b>: Wait! Just a sec! Can you sign-
</dd>,<dd><b>Princess Bubblegum</b>: [<i>closes the VK in</i>] Sorry. Too late.
</dd>,<dd>[<i>Pepbut gives a disappointed sigh.</i>]
</dd>,<dd><b>Vampire King</b>: [<i>telepathically to Peppermint Butler</i>] Hey. Peppermint Butler. I can hear your brains. Look inside your book.
</dd>,<dd>[<i>Peppermint Butler opens his book.</i>]
</dd>,<dd><b>Princess Bubblegum</b>: [<i>lowering goggles to protect eyes</i>] Okay, shields down, everybody!
</dd>,<dd><b>Peppermint Butler</b>: [<i>still looking inside book</i>] A psychic autograph! Thank you, your darkness.
</dd>,<dd><b>Princess Bubblegum</b>: [<i>pulling lever</i>] Here we go.
</dd>,<dd>[<i>blinding light fills the cabin from the machine. Peppermint Butler, who is without safety goggles, clutches his face and yells in pain.

</dd>,<dd><b>Princess Bubblegum</b>: His vampire essence is now completely drained. [<i>takes off goggles</i>] Well, let's see what we've got left.

</dd>,<dd><b>Marceline</b>: [<i>happily</i>] Kitty!
</dd>,<dd><b>Jake</b>: [<i>waving his arms around</i>] Best makeover ever!
</dd>,<dd>[<i>scene changes and we see the cow eating grass outside. Inside, Marceline eats a waffle sandwich stuffed with many different foods.

</dd>,<dd><b>Princess Bubblegum</b>: [<i>to Pepbut</i>] Hey Pep.
</dd>,<dd><b>Peppermint Butler</b>: [<i>turning around to face her</i>] M'lady?
</dd>,<dd><b>Princess Bubblegum</b>: Are you sure your peepers are all right?
</dd>,<dd><b>Peppermint Butler</b>: My inner vision is extraordinarily developed.
</dd>,<dd><b>Princess Bubblegum</b>: Okay, great. 'Cause I need you to go to the secret catacombs and bury this nasty bucket of sludge in the deep-deep down. [<i>holds up the bucket that contains all the vampire essence</i>] Just be uber-duber careful not to drop it. Pure vampire essence this powerful could kaboom reality off its whack.
</dd>,<dd><b>Peppermint Butler</b>: Don't drop the bucket.
</dd>,<dd><b>Princess Bubblegum</b>: Exactly. [<i>hands over the bucket</i>]
</dd>,<dd><b>Peppermint Butler</b>: [<i>takes bucket and begins to walk away</i>] Will do.
</dd>,<dd>[<i>Pepbut unknowingly steps on the lion's tail, which angers it and causes it to swipe at Pepbut, knocking the bucket out of his hands. PB catches it, but the lion rams into her. This causes the bucket to go flying. Pepbut yells in slow motion, grabs a baguette off of Marcy's table, and uses it to whack the bucket in the other direction before it hit the ground. It goes flying yet again. Pepbut chases it as PB, under the lion, yells. The bucket hits the ground next to the sleeping Jake, where it rolls to him, unscathed. Pepbut sighs with relief.</i>]
</dd>,<dd><b>Jake</b>: [<i>half-asleep, reaching for the bucket</i>] Mm... buckie...
</dd>,<dd><b>Peppermint Butler</b>: [<i>runs at Jake</i>] <i>Nooooooo!</i>
</dd>,<dd>[<i>It's too late. The bucket violently explodes, smoke rising into the air in a mushroom cloud. The cloud begins to morph into something. PB lifts a emerges from the rubble and sees the dark cloud form the shape of a giagantic black lion. It roars.</i>]

</dd>,<dd><b>Finn</b>:  Hey, Jake, what's wrong? You look dumpy. How come? Is it because of that metal box? Is something sad inside?
</dd>,<dd><b>Jake</b>:  No. It's nothin'.
</dd>,<dd><b>Finn</b>:  There's <i>lots</i> of boxes that have nothing in them, but also, you can <i>put</i> something in the box, and then it won't be empty. Does that make you feel better?
</dd>,<dd><b>Jake</b>:  Ha ha. You're a charmer, Finn Human. No... it's... well... <a href=""/wiki/Lady_Rainicorn"" title=""Lady Rainicorn"">Lady Rainicorn</a> doesn't wanna play the game <i><a href=""/wiki/Card_Wars_(game)"" title=""Card Wars (game)"">Card Wars</a></i> with me. I always beat 'er... so she says, ""No more Card Warring.""
</dd>,<dd><b>Finn</b>:  What's <i>Card Wars</i>?
</dd>,<dd><b>Jake</b>:  It's a fantasy card game that's super complicated and awesome, but—well... No, it's kinda stupid. Never mind.
</dd>,<dd><b>Finn</b>:  How come you never talked about it before? It sounds cool!
</dd>,<dd><b>Jake</b>:  Really? Well... I thought you'd say it was for nerds who do not know how life is outside of the nerd universe.
</dd>,<dd><b>Finn</b>:  It is, man. But I still totally wanna play it. So no more moping, okay?
</dd>,<dd><b>Jake</b>:  Thanks, Finn.
</dd>,<dd>[<i>Scene transition. The two have drinks and the game in hand. Jake gets rid of dishes on the table and they put they're paraphernalia on it. BMO enters with a <a href=""/wiki/BMO%27s_skateboard"" title=""BMO's skateboard"">skateboard</a>.</i>]
</dd>,<dd><b>Jake</b>:  Oh, hey, BMO. You wanna play, too?
</dd>,<dd><b>BMO</b>:  No. I do not play such games... with Jake.
</dd>,<dd><b>Finn</b>:  What's <i>that</i> mean?
</dd>,<dd><b>Jake</b>:  Ah, whatever. Let's play the game.
</dd>,<dd>[<i>Finn eats some chips and Jake sets up the board.</i>]
</dd>,<dd><b>Finn</b>:  So what kinda stakes do we play for?
</dd>,<dd><b>Jake</b>:  How about... the loser... is a dweeb, and the winner is a cool guy?
</dd>,<dd><b>Finn</b>:  Those are good stakes.
</dd>,<dd>[<i>Jake pours soda into the cups in front of him. He begins to add extra ingredients to the one on the left.</i>]
</dd>,<dd><b>Jake</b>:  Coffee ground, beetle butter, grape jelly, kimchi, and... this stuff. [<i>It's a bottle of pink liquid that says ""HAM CHUNK JUICE.""</i>]
</dd>,<dd><b>Finn</b>:  Hey! You're ruining that pop with weird taste!
</dd>,<dd>[<i>Jake writes ""DWEEB"" on the left cup and ""COOL GUY"" on the right one.</i>]
</dd>,<dd><b>Jake</b>:  We drink when the game is over.
</dd>,<dd><b>Finn</b>:  Oh, gross.
</dd>,<dd><b>Jake</b>:  Now lemme explain the rules.
</dd>,<dd>[<i>Time card: 2 HOURS LATER...</i>]
</dd>,<dd><b>Jake</b>:  That's basically the basics! So once we have our kingdom set up... [<i>Floops land cards</i>] ...it's time to start to play. FOR THE GLORY! [<i>Finn wakes up with a dazed ""Whuh?""</i>] Hey, were you asleep?! I'll have to explain it all over again!
</dd>,<dd><b>Finn</b>:  Doesn't matter. Let's just play.
</dd>,<dd><b>Jake</b>:  But if you don't know the rules then you're gonna lose in the first couple rounds, like Lady always does! And then you'll <i>hate</i> the game, and then you'll hate <i>me</i>, and then... and then...
</dd>,<dd><b>Finn</b>:  [<i>Scoffs</i>] You think you're gonna win? I'm gonna <i>crush</i> you! Party-dance-style, dweeb!
</dd>,<dd><b>Jake</b>:  Haha! Bring it!
</dd>,<dd><b>Finn</b>:  So... how do I get my land on the map?
</dd>,<dd><b>Jake</b>:  Oh... you, uh, floop your land cards.
</dd>,<dd>[<i>Finn does so, and his land and buildings appear.</i>]
</dd>,<dd><b>Finn</b>:  Uh...
</dd>,<dd><b>Jake</b>:  Keep those honeys hidden, or I'll get a strategic advantage!
</dd>,<dd><b>Finn</b>:  Oh! [<i>Holds cards closer</i>] Hmmm...
</dd>,<dd><b>Jake</b>:  Okay, I go first. I floop the Silo of Truth!
</dd>,<dd>[<i>The Silo appears and it reveals what cards Finn has in hand.</i>]
</dd>,<dd><b>Finn</b>:  [<i>Gasps</i>] Hey!!
</dd>,<dd><b>Jake</b>:  Pfff, you got really lame cards. Hmm. I'll take the Cerebral Bloodstorm, though.
</dd>,<dd><b>Finn</b>:  Huh? [<i>Jake claims the card.</i>]
</dd>,<dd><b>Jake</b>:  Okay, now it's the battle phase. I'm attackin' your schoolhouse with my Husker Knights. [<i>Activates Husker Knights</i>] And I'm castin' Cerebral Bloodstorm! [<i>Does so</i>] So, what'll you use to defend?
</dd>,<dd><b>Finn</b>:  Uh... Can my Cool Dog and Ancient Scholar defeat your Husker Knights?
</dd>,<dd><b>Jake</b>:  [<i>Laughs</i>] Of <i>course</i> not!
</dd>,<dd><b>Finn</b>:  Hmm. Then I floop the Pig.
</dd>,<dd><b>Jake</b>:  What?! [<i>Laughs</i>]
</dd>,<dd><b>Finn</b>:  What?
</dd>,<dd><b>Jake</b>:  Okay... okay, <i>first</i> of all, you don't floop a creature to make it fight. You <i>activate</i> a creature.
</dd>,<dd><b>Finn</b>:  Hmm. No. It says I can <i>floop</i> the Pig. See?
</dd>,<dd>[<i>The Pig is flooped onto the battlefield. It runs past the knights and storm and starts eating Jake's cornfields.</i>]
</dd>,<dd><b>Jake</b>:  [<i>Gasps</i>] No... He's eating all my cornfields! My Husker Knights draw energy from corn! [<i>His knights collapse.</i>]
</dd>,<dd><b>Finn</b>:  And, since I'm not actually attacking, your Cerebral Bloodstorm only does damage... to your <i>own</i> kingdom's troops.
</dd>,<dd><b>Jake</b>:  [<i>Big gasp</i>] You just wiped out my entire attack!!
</dd>,<dd><b>Finn</b>:  What do you expect if all your power units come from <i>corn</i>? Pigs <i>eat</i> corn, dude. Cornfields stink.
</dd>,<dd><b>Jake</b>:  CORNFIELDS ARE AWESOME! What makes you think you know so much about <i>Card Wars</i>?!
</dd>,<dd><b>Finn</b>:  It's just logic!
</dd>,<dd><b>Jake</b>:  ...Your turn.
</dd>,<dd><b>Finn</b>:  Hmm...
</dd>,<dd><b>Jake</b>:  You're supposed to discard a card and pick up a new one first.
</dd>,<dd><b>Finn</b>:  Oh. Right.
</dd>,<dd><b>Jake</b>:  Look at you. You're a babe in the woods. Your beginner's luck ends this round!
</dd>,<dd><b>Finn</b>:  Hmm. [<i>Discards a card and picks up another. He activates it.</i>]
</dd>,<dd><b>Jake</b>:  Spirit Tower?! <i>And</i> the Cave of Solitude?!
</dd>,<dd><b>Finn</b>:  Now my battle phase begins. I activate my Ancient Scholar... to begin studying. [<i>The Ancient Scholar enters the schoolhouse to study.</i>] And I also move my Pig to the Cave of Solitude so he can take a nap.
</dd>,<dd><b>Jake</b>:  That's <i>it</i>? You're not attacking?
</dd>,<dd><b>Finn</b>:  I'll attack on a different turn.
</dd>,<dd><b>Jake</b>:  HA! Then the seas have aligned and the five winds waft the smell of victory to my palace doors! I cast Field of Nightmares and activate my Legion of Earlings to scare your Pig to death!
</dd>,<dd><b>Finn</b>:  My Pig's in the Cave of Solitude.
</dd>,<dd><b>Jake</b>:  Um... I cast Teleport—to move your Pig to the empty field so I <i>can</i> attack 'im!
</dd>,<dd><b>Finn</b>:  Uh... wouldn't Teleport only work on your <i>own</i> creatures?
</dd>,<dd><b>Jake</b>:  You're right. I'm gonna slay that Pig, though!
</dd>,<dd><b>Finn</b>:  How? You don't have any creatures that can touch 'im! [<i>Jake grunts angrily.</i>] Face it, man. I'm the cool guy.
</dd>,<dd><b>Jake</b>:  Hmm. [<i>Gasps</i>] You're the cool guy, huh? Well, lemme make it a little <i>hot</i> for you, then. [<i>Flooping Volcano card</i>] Heh heh heh heh... I floop the Volcano!
</dd>,<dd><b>Finn</b>:  What?! That'll destroy your kingdom <i>too</i>, won't it?!
</dd>,<dd><b>Jake</b>:  Hmm. Maybe.
</dd>,<dd>[<i>Volcano spews lava, killing everything on the board. The Earlings scream as they are burned to death.</i>]
</dd>,<dd><b>Finn</b>:  Aah!! My Pig!!
</dd>,<dd><b>Jake</b>:  [<i>Chuckles deviously</i>] The Pig is dead. Now I reconstitute my cornfields using the Reclaim Landscape spell! [<i>Does it</i>] My Husker Knights revive! And I still have my battle phase! Hiding in the Useless Swamp... the Immortal Maize Walker!
</dd>,<dd>[<i>Immortal Maize Walker appears on board.</i>]
</dd>,<dd><b>Immortal Maize Walker</b>:  I LOVE CORN!
</dd>,<dd>[<i>Finn makes a worried noise.</i>]
</dd>,<dd><b>Jake</b>:  Cornfields give the Immortal Maize Walker triple damage.
</dd>,<dd>[<i>With that, the Immortal Maize Walker grows more brightly and shockingly evil-looking.</i>]
</dd>,<dd><b>Finn</b>:  Uhh...
</dd>,<dd><b>Jake</b>:  I <i>told</i> you cornfields are awesome! Your Ancient Scholar and Cool Dog won't survive <i>this</i> time!
</dd>,<dd>[<i>The Immortal Maize Walker and Husker Knights move forward to attack.</i>]
</dd>,<dd><b>Finn</b>:  Actually, my Ancient Scholar's been studying the Raise the Dead ability.
</dd>,<dd>[<i>The Ancient Scholar comes out of the schoolhouse, holding a spellbook.</i>]
</dd>,<dd><b>Jake</b>: So what?
</dd>,<dd><b>Finn</b>: So, my Ancient Scholar raises the dead. [<i>The Pig is revived.</i>] I floop the Pig.
</dd>,<dd><b>Jake</b>:  NOOOOO!
</dd>,<dd>[<i>The Pig eats Jake's corn; the Husker Knights collapse.</i>]
</dd>,<dd><b>Finn</b>:  Look! My Tower's doin' a thing!
</dd>,<dd>[<i>The Spirit Tower sends its waves to the Immortal Maize Walker. It appears on Finn's side and is now blue.</i>]
</dd>,<dd><b>Immortal Maize Walker</b>:  HOMINY, HOMINY, HOMINY!
</dd>,<dd><b>Jake</b>:  YOU GANKED MY SPIRIT WALKER! AAAAGH!!! [<i>Runs away from the table and angrily mutters incomprehensible words to himself</i>]
</dd>,<dd><b>Finn</b>:  Uh... Maybe we should take a break?
</dd>,<dd><b>Jake</b>:  [<i>Makes a strange, low noise</i>] Your turn.
</dd>,<dd><b>Finn</b>:  Huh?!
</dd>,<dd>[<i>Jake grows to a monstrous size and threateningly grabs Finn.</i>]
</dd>,<dd><b>Jake</b>:  YOU PLAY! YOU PLAY! [<i>Retracts</i>]
</dd>,<dd><b>Finn</b>:  [<i>To himself</i>] Oh, zing.
</dd>,<dd><b>BMO [<i>flashback</i>]</b>:  I do not play such games... with Jake.
</dd>,<dd><b>Finn</b>:  Sorry! I gotta use the boy-style room! [<i>Runs away quickly</i>] [<i>Whispering</i>] BMO! BMO!
</dd>,<dd>[<i>BMO randomly falls onto Finn's shoulder and karate chops him.</i>]
</dd>,<dd><b>BMO</b>:  BMO chop! If this were a real attack, you'd be dead.
</dd>,<dd><b>Finn</b>:  BMO! Jake's acting banununununus!
</dd>,<dd><b>BMO</b>:  Oh, no! Are you winning the game of <i>Card Wars</i>?
</dd>,<dd><b>Finn</b>:  Yeah!
</dd>,<dd><b>BMO</b>:  That's terrible! If Jake loses the game, he gets super depressed! When I beat him, he wouldn't talk to me for a month!
</dd>,<dd><b>Finn</b>:  What?! I only played so he <i>wouldn't</i> be bummed!
</dd>,<dd><b>BMO</b>:  Finn, you must take a dive.
</dd>,<dd><b>Finn</b>:  Okay, I'll try. But... I'm a <i>Card Wars</i> super Amadeus!
</dd>,<dd>[<i>Jake's strected appendages capture Finn and pull him back to the table.</i>]
</dd>,<dd><b>Jake</b>:  Play. The. Game.
</dd>,<dd><b>Finn</b>:  [<i>Thinking</i>] Grob. Better make this look good. [<i>Breathes deeply</i>] [<i>Out loud</i>] Alright, Jake. Prepare for my ultimo attack!
</dd>,<dd><b>Jake</b>:  Well... I've still got my Wandering Bald Man. [<i>The Wandering Bald Man gets stuck in Jake's mud landscape.</i>] Oh, no.
</dd>,<dd><b>Finn</b>:  [<i>Thinking</i>] I need to get rid of my Pig so Jake can reconstitute his cornfields. [<i>Finn thinks for a second, then smiles.</i>] [<i>Out loud</i>] I activate the Pig—to attack your Wandering Bald Man.
</dd>,<dd><b>Jake</b>:  Well, that's stupid. Just attack with the Immortal Maize Walker and get the game over with.
</dd>,<dd><b>Finn</b>:  No way! You've underestimated me and my Pig all day!
</dd>,<dd>[<i>The Pig goes to the Wandering Bald Man and attacks it.</i>]
</dd>,<dd><b>Finn</b>:  [<i>Thinking</i>] Please lose. Please lose!
</dd>,<dd>[<i>The Wandering Bald Man slaps the Pig, but the Pig defeats him. The scene is suddenly in slow motion. Jake discards a card.</i>]
</dd>,<dd><b>Finn</b>:  Noooo!
</dd>,<dd><b>Jake</b>:  I...
</dd>,<dd>[<i>The Pig gets stuck in the mud and turns yellow.</i>]
</dd>,<dd><b>Jake</b>:  OHHH-HO! Ohhh, oh, yeah! Pigs can't leave mud landscapes once they're on them! Hahaha! The Pig is mine! First, I'll play Reclaim Landscape, then I cast Summon Archer Dan!
</dd>,<dd>[<i>Archer Dan appears and destroys Finn's buildings.</i>]
</dd>,<dd><b>Finn</b>:  [<i>To himself</i>] Whoa. Math.
</dd>,<dd>[<i>Jake plays the Reaper card and steals the souls of Finn's creatures. The Immortal Maize Walker is orange-red again, the Ancient Scholar is now orange, and the Cool Dog is now green. The three go to Jake's side of the board.</i>]
</dd>,<dd><b>Finn</b>:  My boys!
</dd>,<dd><b>Jake</b>:  You have no creatures left. That's the game, boyee!! The five winds blow through cornfields once again! For the glory of Jakoria!
</dd>,<dd><b>Finn</b>:  Heh. You got me.
</dd>,<dd><b>Jake</b>:  [<i>Slams Finn's face on the board</i>] In yo' face! It's time to drink up! It looks like you are the dweeb and I'm the cool guy! [<i>Drinks from the ""COOL GUY"" cup</i>] [<i>Finn sniffs the ""DWEEB"" cup and retches. Jake frowns.</i>] Is it... too gross for you, man?
</dd>,<dd><b>Finn</b>:  No, no. I gotta take what's coming to me. [<i>Drinks it and smiles</i>] Hey... Not that bad! I like it!
</dd>,<dd><b>Jake</b>:  WHAT?!
</dd>,<dd><b>Finn</b>:  You want a taste?
</dd>,<dd>[<i>Jake sips it and immediately spits it out.</i>]
</dd>,<dd><b>Jake</b>:  AW, IT'S GROSS!
</dd>,<dd><b>Finn</b>:  [<i>Laughs</i>] In your face, dweeb!
</dd>,<dd>[<i>Finn comes over to Jake and sips the cup again. Jake sips it again, too. They both laugh. They both continue sipping the ""DWEEB"" cup. As they do so, BMO enters and just shakes its head at them before the episode ends.</i>]

</dd>,<dd><b>Finn, Jake and Princess Bubblegum</b>:  Lumpy Space Princess!
</dd>,<dd><b>Princess Bubblegum</b>:  Whats wrong?!
</dd>,<dd><b>LSP</b>:  You guys! Somebody stole something from me! Something I can't live without! [<i>starts making noises and grunting</i>]
</dd>,<dd><b>Princess Bubblegum</b>:  I'll get something to calm her down. [<i>Princess Bubblegum walks away</i>]

</dd>,<dd><b>LSP</b>:  [<i>in normal voice</i>] It...was...puh...pee...pete...sa...sas...as...[<i>mumbles incoherently and falls down to the ground</i>]
</dd>,<dd><b>Princess Bubblegum</b>:  I think I gave her too much.
</dd>,<dd>[<i>Finn and Jake face each other and have a quiet conversation.</i>]
</dd>,<dd><b>Finn</b>:  Jake. A crime has been committed. We must find the criminal.
</dd>,<dd><b>Jake</b>:  We must.
</dd>,<dd><b>Finn</b>:  [<i>looks up</i>] And retrieve whatever it is that was stolen from Lumpy Space Princess.
</dd>,<dd><b>Jake</b>:  [<i>looks up</i>] Stolen. But all we have to go on is part of a name. Pete something. [<i>Jake transforms into a magnifying glass</i>] Need more clues! Hold me! [<i>jumps into Finn's hand</i>]
</dd>,<dd>[<i>Finn walks over to where LSP is lying down unconscious. He tries to use Jake as a magnifying glass.</i>]
</dd>,<dd><b>Finn</b>:  Clues, clues, clues.
</dd>,<dd><b>LSP</b>:  [<i>mumbles incoherently and holds up a golden key.</i>]
</dd>,<dd><b>Finn</b>:  What's that? I can't see it.
</dd>,<dd><b>Jake</b>:  Oop, sorry. [<i>opens mouth so there is a hole where the glass would be if he were really a magnifying glass</i>] Aah!
</dd>,<dd><b>Finn</b>:  There's something in her hand! [<i>picks it up</i>] A key! A key to...what? Three zero three. Hmm.
</dd>,<dd><b>Jake</b>:  [<i>closes his mouth so he can look at the key</i>] Ooh, turn it around! [<i>opens mouth again.</i>]

Inside is a purple room, worn down and littered with garbage. They both investigate the room. Finn searches using a flashlight, and Jake looks through stuff in the room.</i>]
</dd>,<dd><b>Finn</b>:  Hmm. Find anything, Jake?
</dd>,<dd><b>Jake</b>:  [<i>pulling out a plastic bag from inside another plastic bag</i>] Got some bags and...wait- [<i>pulls out another plastic bag</i>] more bags. But no leads on Pete something.
</dd>,<dd><b>Finn</b>:  [<i>shining flashlight on can.</i>] Same here. BMO. [<i>BMO pops out of Finn's backpack.</i>] Start marking evidence.
</dd>,<dd>[<i>BMO gets out of Finn's backpack and starts drawing lines around things inside the room and marking them with little flags. Jake is then shown shaking a potato chips bag. He finds some crumbs and eats them.</i>]
</dd>,<dd><b>Jake</b>:  Hmm.
</dd>,<dd>[<i>Finn opens the curtains in the room, and looks over Candy Kingdom. He spots a drugstore.</i>]
</dd>,<dd><b>Finn</b>:  Hmm.
</dd>,<dd><b>BMO</b>:  [<i>drawing hand turkeys on the wall</i>] Hmm.
</dd>,<dd><b>Finn</b>:  [<i>Finn lifts a wooden log and finds a red substance.</i>] Dude, check this! [<i>Jake walks over.</i>] Is this blood?
</dd>,<dd>[<i>Jake turns into a magnifying glass and looks at the ""blood.""</i>]
</dd>,<dd><b>Jake</b>:  Yeah man, that's definitely blood.
</dd>,<dd><b>Finn</b>:  Hmm. LSP's injuries were 100 percent emotional. So it has to belong to Pete Sa-something. BMO, take a sample and do a full blood analysis. [<i>in a Jersey accent</i>] The works. [<i>in normal accent</i>] Hey, if that guy cut himself during the robbery, he might have gone somewhere to buy a mini adhesive bandage. There's a drugstore across the street!
</dd>,<dd><b>Jake</b>:  [<i>Jake jumps into Finn's hand.</i>] Let's roll. [<i>Jake morphs into a blob and consumes Finn within his body.</i>]
</dd>,<dd><b>Finn</b>:  Woah!
</dd>,<dd>[<i>Jake turns into a police car and drives himself out the window. He lands in front of the drugstore. He parks himself while making car noises. The scene changes inside the drug store where <a href=""/wiki/Ann"" title=""Ann"">Ann</a> is talking to a customer.</i>]
</dd>,<dd><b>Ann</b>:  And if the oozing persists, just come back [<i>leans over</i>] [<i>in a slightly hushed tone</i>] and I'll give you something a little stronger.
</dd>,<dd><b>Finn</b>:  [<i>Finn comes up from under the counter, pushing the customer out of the way.</i>] I'm Finn. This is my partner, Jake. [<i>Finn pulls up Jake who is in the form of a police badge.</i>]
</dd>,<dd><b>Jake</b>:  Hello, citizen. Had anyone in here looking to buy some mini adhesive bandages today?
</dd>,<dd><b>Ann</b>:  A lot of people come through my store, gentlemen. You can't seriously think I'd be able to remember any one particular customer among the countless others I see on a daily basis, now, can you?
</dd>,<dd><b>Finn</b>:  I guess not. Fair dues. C'mon, Jake.
</dd>,<dd><b>Ann</b>:  [<i>holding her finger up</i>] Wait! Now that you mention it, there was this one guy in here earlier. Real suspicious type. Had a nosebleed. Said it was the first one he'd had in years. [<i>As Ann is talking, Finn gets out a notepad and pencil.</i>] Used to get them all the time as a kid, he said. [<i>Jake slaps away the real notepad, and turns into a fake notepad for Finn to write on. He jumps into Finn's hands.</i>] Can never remember if he was supposed to pinch his nose and hold his head back, or pinch his nose and hold his head forward. [<i>As Finn tries to write on Jake, Jake blocks the pencil from writing on his body.</i>] Maybe it was a case of being boxed on the nose too many times. [<i>Finn finally pokes Jake, who stifles his laughter.</i>] Made the blood vessels in his lower septum weak and vulnerable to hemorrhaging. Anyway, his mammy always said it was because he couldn't keep all those picky little fingers out of his dirty little nose holes. [<i>As Ann is talking, Jake climbs on top of Finn's head and turns into a police hat.</i>] He didn't buy it though. He always thought it had-
</dd>,<dd><b>Finn</b>:  Ma'am, can you give us a name?
</dd>,<dd><b>Ann</b>:  Mmm, nope. No wait, yes I can. <a href=""/wiki/Pete_Sassafras"" title=""Pete Sassafras"">Pete Sassafras</a>.
</dd>,<dd>[<i>Finn and Jake look at each other with surprised looks. A transparent LSP flies across the screen from earlier saying, ""Pete...sa...sass...as...""</i>]
</dd>,<dd><b>Finn</b>:  Did you catch which way he was going?
</dd>,<dd><b>Ann</b>:  Of course! He said he was catching a train at 11:27, Candy Kingdom Station, Platform 5. Heh. Sorry, I wish I could remember more.
</dd>,<dd>[<i>Scene switches to Candy Kingdom Station, where Finn is looking through binoculars to try and find Pete Sassafras.</i>]
</dd>,<dd><b>Jake</b>:  See anyone who might be our guy?
</dd>,<dd><b>Finn</b>:  [<i>sighs</i>] Nope. [<i>Camera angle changes so we can see what Finn sees through the binoculars.</i>] Nobody's suspicious here. Just a load of decent law-abiding folk. [<i>Jake pushes binoculars away from Finn's eyes.</i>] What the-?! Jake! What's with all the turning into stuff today?
</dd>,<dd><b>Jake</b>:  I really like turnin' into cop stuff. I literally can't stop turning into cop stuff. [<i>Scene changes into Jake's perspective. Jake puts on binoculars and looks at Platform 5.</i>] Hey, there's Platform 5! [<i>He looks down and sees a guy in an overcoat, and hiding in his clothes. Jake gasps.</i>] I see a nasty tranch!
</dd>,<dd><b>Finn</b>:  Let's book him, son.
</dd>,<dd>[<i>Finn and Jake run after the man, apologizing to disgruntled people as they run past them at the train station. Scene changes to show the man almost walk onto the train. Scene switches again to Finn and Jake jumping over the turnstyles.</i>]
</dd>,<dd><b>Finn</b>:  [<i>at the man</i>] Stop right there! What's under that skeezy trenchcoat ya-
</dd>,<dd><b>Blueberry Cop 1</b>:  [<i>shouts</i>] Crook! [<i>Finn and Jake grunt loudly.</i>] Busted! For attempting to board a train without a ticket.
</dd>,<dd>[<i>The train whistles just as the man gets on board. Finn and Jake look on in horror. The train drives by them, leaving them in Candy Kingdom.</i>]
</dd>,<dd><b>Finn</b>:  Oh, guys, he's getting away!
</dd>,<dd><b>Jake</b>:  We're not criminals, man! We're working the beat, just like you!
</dd>,<dd><b>Blueberry Cop 1</b>:  Jimmy?
</dd>,<dd><b>Blueberry Cop 2 (Jimmy)</b>:  [<i>licks Jake</i>] Yup. Checks out. He tastes like police.
</dd>,<dd><b>Blueberry Cop 1</b>:  [<i>sighs</i>] Sorry about that, officers, it was an honest mistake.

</dd>,<dd><b>Jake</b>:  Save it for the candy judge, Pete.

</dd>,<dd><b>Jake</b>:  We are awesome at being cops! [<i>while eating a donut</i>] No question about that.
</dd>,<dd><b>Finn</b>:  [<i>sighs</i>] Call me crazy, but I was thinking maybe we should actually become detectives. Like, as a job! When we were out on the streets back there, getting those leads, busting that perp, it just felt so...I don't know...right.

</dd>,<dd><b>Jake</b>:  Yeah, good work, BMO!
</dd>,<dd><b>Finn</b>:  It's Pete Sassafras's blood, right?
</dd>,<dd><b>BMO</b>:  No. It doesn't belong to anyone because it's not blood. It's tomato sauce.

</dd>,<dd><b>Finn</b>:  Uh... I don't know, was the hug okay? Give me some tips man.
</dd>,<dd><b>Jake</b>:  Bro, you gotta let things take their natural path. Look, look [<i>Turns right arm to 15 small stairsteps</i>], let me explain some junk about dating. Right now, [<i>Points left finger to first step</i>], you're at Tier 1, which is hugging. But pretty soon, [<i>Points left finger to second step</i>] you'll be at Tier 2, which is smooching. Then down the road [<i>points left finger to fifth step</i>], you'll make it to Tier 5, where she'll let you discover all fifteen feet of her loong, beautiful stomach. Then after awhile, you'll make it to Tier 8 [<i>points left finger to eighth step</i>], where you touch her horn for the very first time. Very special.
</dd>,<dd><b>Finn</b>:  [<i>Very curious</i>] [<i>Pops out his left arm and points left finger to fifteenth step</i>] What about Tier 15?
</dd>,<dd><b>Jake</b>:  [<i>Warns Finn while pointing his left finger at him</i>] You stay away from that! Do not do Tier 15!

</dd>,<dd><b>Jake</b>:  Oh.
</dd>,<dd><b>Finn</b>:  I'm gonna take a shower. Princess, do not inhale!
</dd>,<dd><b>Princess Bubblegum</b>:  What? Why?

</dd>,<dd><b>Finn</b>:  Word. [<i>Then flips out of the Tree Fort's front door</i>]
</dd>,<dd>[<i>Jake turns around and sees more boring stuff.</i>]
</dd>,<dd><b>Princess Bubblegum</b>:  If too much frustration builds, the magma will erupt causing a catastrophic super-stratum of igneous rock to form......

</dd>,<dd><b>Finn</b>:  Oh, uh, hi, Princess. I'm, uhh, writing something for Jake.
</dd>,<dd><b>Princess Bubblegum</b>:  Oh, well, speaking of Jake. Did he explain everything to you?
</dd>,<dd><b>Finn</b>:  Yyeah.
</dd>,<dd><b>Princess Bubblegum</b>:  And you understand?
</dd>,<dd><b>Finn</b>:  [<i>Turns around</i>] Yeah, I understand.
</dd>,<dd><b>Princess Bubblegum</b>:  Finn, sometimes you want someone and you [<i>puts hand on Finn's left knee</i>] want to kiss them, and be with them. But you can't, because responsibility demands sacrifice.
</dd>,<dd><b>Finn</b>:  [<i>Finn is angered, blushing and he retaliates</i>] What are you trying to say?!
</dd>,<dd><b>Princess Bubblegum</b>:  I'm trying to say that you're a hero, Finn. You're my hero. So, I'm glad you understand why you can't be with Flame Princess.
</dd>,<dd><b>Finn</b>:  [<i>Still angered, stands up for himself and Flame Princess</i>] Grr... Bubblegum! I can't do this anymore!
</dd>,<dd><b>Princess Bubblegum</b>:  What?

Now I'm ready to move on, and it's like...rrmph!! You're gonna build me up all over again! Well, I'm done! I'm done. [<i>Leaves Princess Bubblegum for herself</i>]
</dd>,<dd><b>Princess Bubblegum</b>:  [<i>Picks up a piece of crumpled paper and tries reading it, then quietly exclaims</i>] Oh, no!
</dd>,<dd>[<i>Later at the Tree Fort, Jake is making and singing ""<a href=""/wiki/Bacon_Pancakes"" title=""Bacon Pancakes"">Bacon Pancakes</a>""</i>]
</dd>,<dd>[<i>Then Princess Bubblegum appears climbing up a ladder.</i>]
</dd>,<dd><b>Princess Bubblegum</b>:  Finn! Jake, where's Finn? Is he with Flame Princess?
</dd>,<dd><b>Jake</b>:  [<i>Taps the frying pan</i>] Back off, Bubblegum! That's his ""man's biz.""
</dd>,<dd><b>Princess Bubblegum</b>:  Is he with her?! [<i>Shows the crumpled paper to Jake</i>] Or not?!
</dd>,<dd><b>Jake</b>:  [<i>Jake is angered and he retaliates</i>] You heartless monster! Do you have any idea how much he's CRIED OVER YOU? Finn deserves to be happy, even if his blooping face gets burned off! [<i>Picks up PANCAKE TOWER box</i>] You should be [<i>throws box to Princess Bubblegum</i>] ashamed! [<i>Princess Bubblegum dodges the box</i>] You're SICK! [<i>Points and blames Princess Bubblegum for everything</i>]
</dd>,<dd><b>Princess Bubblegum</b>:  What are you..? This isn't about some [<i>crumbles the paper</i>] petty love triangle! Flame Princess is physically unstable! [<i>Explains</i>] Her elemental matrix can't handle extreme romance! Glob, if Finn tries to <i>kiss</i> her, she'll burn so hot, she'll melt right through the planet's crust, down through the molten core, then she'll be thrown back and forth by gravity until she burns out the world from the inside! Why do you think I had her father keep her locked up?!
</dd>,<dd><b>Jake</b>:  [<i>Shocked and Gasps</i>]
</dd>,<dd><b>Princess Bubblegum</b>:  Will you take me to them?
</dd>,<dd>[<i>Jake turns around, shuts the burner, grabs Princess Bubblegum, grows huge, breaks the wall, and makes a run for it.</i>]
</dd>,<dd><b>Princess Bubblegum</b>:  Faster!
</dd>,<dd>[<i>Later, near Flame Princess's house</i>]
</dd>,<dd><b>Finn</b>:  [<i>Blushing while reciting his poem for Flame Princess.</i>] Your wavelengths are my weakness, your emissions are what I've been missing. [<i>Then the poem is accidentally burnt by Flame Princess.</i>]
</dd>,<dd><b>Finn and Flame Princess</b>:  [<i>Both giggle</i>]
</dd>,<dd><b>Flame Princess</b>:  Ahhh.
</dd>,<dd>[<i>Then Finn and Flame Princess lean in to kiss each other.</i>]
</dd>,<dd><b>Princess Bubblegum</b>:  No!
</dd>,<dd>[<i>Finn and Flame Princess kiss for the very first time, followed by a bright light from the instability of Flame Princess's elemental matrix, which throws Finn to the ground.</i>]
</dd>,<dd><b>Finn</b>:  [<i>In pain, with serious burns around the lips</i>] Ohhhh-uh, Flame Princess! [<i>Crawls to the melted hole</i>]
</dd>,<dd>[<i>Flame Princess continues to melt and fall through the Earth's crust.</i>]
</dd>,<dd><b>Finn</b>:  FLAME PRINCESS!
</dd>,<dd><b>Jake</b>:  [<i>Panting</i>] Finn!
</dd>,<dd><b>Princess Bubblegum</b>:  Finn, there's no time! You have to...
</dd>,<dd><b>Jake</b>:  Are you alright?
</dd>,<dd>[<i>Finn grabs Jake's right arm, ties it around himself, and jumps into the hole after Flame Princess.</i>]
</dd>,<dd><b>Princess Bubblegum</b>:  Finn!
</dd>,<dd><b>Jake</b>:  [<i>Difficulty of handling Finn keeps increasing. He slips and covers the entire hole.</i>]
</dd>,<dd><b>Finn</b>:  [<i>Panting, then he hits ground. The surrounding scene color changes from red to violet.</i>] Ohhh-tsst. Flame Princess!
</dd>,<dd><b>Jake</b>:  [<i>In pain</i>] It's hot!
</dd>,<dd><b>Princess Bubblegum</b>:  Wait, wait! Don't move. This is good! If you stay on the hole for 24.8 seconds, the reaction will be deprived of oxygen. [<i>Hushed voice</i>] She'll go out.
</dd>,<dd><b>Jake</b>:  [<i>Still in pain</i>] Geh.. What about Finn?
</dd>,<dd>[<i>At the bottom of the hole</i>]
</dd>,<dd><b>Finn</b>:  Hey! [<i>Struggling to breathe</i>] What's wrong? Please, say something. [<i>Breathes twice</i>] Please... [<i>breathes</i>] I need you... [<i>breathes</i>] to be okay. [<i>Takes a deep breath and gives Flame Princess air to save her.</i>]
</dd>,<dd>[<i>Flame Princess burns again and regains consciousness.</i>]
</dd>,<dd>[<i>Finn loses consciousness, with added burns to the right side of his face.</i>]
</dd>,<dd><b>Flame Princess</b>:  Huh, ummm. [<i>Gasps</i>]
</dd>,<dd>[<i>Jake pulls out both Finn and Flame Princess successfully.</i>]

</dd>,<dd><b>Ice King</b>: Yeah. She stole my heart. And my crown.
</dd>,<dd><b>Princess Bubblegum</b>: Your crown.
</dd>,<dd><b>Marceline</b>: Crubs! He's really flipping out! What'd you do that for?!
</dd>,<dd><b>Princess Bubblegum</b>: It just makes things easier.
</dd>,<dd><b>Princess Bubblegum</b>: I'm definitely seeing some weird activity here. It's really, really.
</dd>,<dd><b>Marceline</b>: You don't know what's going on.
</dd>,<dd><b>Princess Bubblegum</b>: Maybe I can access it with my VR equipment.
</dd>,<dd><b>Marceline</b>: Whoa, Bon-bon! This stuff is rad. Why haven't you shown me before?
</dd>,<dd><b>Princess Bubblegum</b>: I didn't think you liked science.
</dd>,<dd><b>Marceline</b>: I like games.
</dd>,<dd><b>Princess Bubblegum</b>: We can play sometime. But this time, it's business.
</dd>,<dd><b>Marceline</b>: Whoa.
</dd>,<dd><b>Princess Bubblegum</b>: This is not what I was expecting.
</dd>,<dd><b>Marceline</b>: Did you press the wrong button?
</dd>,<dd><b>Princess Bubblegum</b>: I never press the wrong button.
</dd>,<dd><b>Marceline</b>: Yeah, you always know which button to press. I'm referring to the fact that you know how to annoy me.
</dd>,<dd><b>Princess Bubblegum</b>: Yeah, I got that. What I don't get is this stupid scenery.
</dd>,<dd><b>Marceline</b>: At least it's got a pretty killer beat.
</dd>,<dd><b><a href=""/wiki/Gunther"" title=""Gunther"" class=""mw-redirect"">Gunther (Evergreen)</a></b>: Wow! Two newbies at the same time! How'd you manage that? Yeah, okay. I guess if you really squeeze together, it could fit you both. Who are you?!
</dd>,<dd><b>Marceline</b>: Are you a dinosaur?
</dd>,<dd><b>Gunther</b>: I'm a Gunther.
</dd>,<dd><b>Princess Bubblegum</b>: Okay, what's a dinosaur doing here?
</dd>,<dd><b>Gunther</b>: I'm practicing my drums. The others say the acoustics out here are better than in town.
</dd>,<dd><b>Marceline</b>: What the bleep?!
</dd>,<dd><b>Gunther</b>: Yeah. That's been happening lately. You're lucky you didn't get rearranged. Ooof!
</dd>,<dd><b>Princess Bubblegum</b>: Does this circuit look infected to you?
</dd>,<dd><b>Marceline</b>: I don't know. I only deal in infectious grooves.
</dd>,<dd><b>Gunther</b>: Sounds like you guys need another brain. I'm gonna take you guys to the the professor! He's the smartest guy I know. Next to Master Evergreen, of course.

</dd>,<dd><b>Sveinn</b>: Prjon. Hey, Goontz!
</dd>,<dd><b>Marceline</b>: Who are those dudes?
</dd>,<dd><b>Gunther</b>: That's Sveinn. He only wore the crown once. And the guy next to him says he's the first ""Santa."" Like, what's even a ""Santa""?
</dd>,<dd><b>Marceline</b>: Dude, the Santa?
</dd>,<dd><b>Princess Bubblegum</b>: Nope. Doesn't ring a bell.
</dd>,<dd><b>Gunther</b>: Aha! There he is! Professor Petrikov!
</dd>,<dd><b>Marceline</b>: Simon!
</dd>,<dd><b>Simon Petrikov</b>: Marcy! Dear! How is this possible? Did my beloved Betty master the secrets of the crown?
</dd>,<dd><b>Marceline</b>: No. Bonnibel scienced us in.
</dd>,<dd><b>Simon Petrikov</b>: You must be Betty's little assistant.
</dd>,<dd><b>Princess Bubblegum</b>: Assistant?! I have been my own boss my entire life. I built my own lab! I've created freaking life forms!
</dd>,<dd><b>Marceline</b>: Okay! Actually, I haven't seen Betty since she came back to Ooo.
</dd>,<dd><b>Simon Petrikov</b>: But if Betty didn't send you, why are you here?
</dd>,<dd><b>Marceline</b>: The crown is going ba-nay-nays.
</dd>,<dd><b>Princess Bubblegum</b>: It's making Ice King act super weird in the real world.
</dd>,<dd><b>Simon Petrikov</b>: Yes, I see. It seems to have infected much of the crown's labyrinth. I was actually just about to follow its path of destruction.
</dd>,<dd><b>Gunther</b>: A quest!
</dd>,<dd><b>Simon Petrikov</b>: Hey, Marcy, last time, I was so caught up in making things right with Betty that you got left out. I'm sorry.
</dd>,<dd><b>Marceline</b>: It's okay. I get it.
</dd>,<dd><b>Simon Petrikov</b>: So, you got a boyfriend yet?
</dd>,<dd><b>Marceline</b>: Ha! No. There was this guy once, but he was a real jerk, so I dumped him hard.
</dd>,<dd><b>Simon Petrikov</b>: Wish I'd been there to punch his face.
</dd>,<dd><b>Marceline</b>: Simon! I can punch my own jerks now.
</dd>,<dd><b>Princess Bubblegum</b>: It's getting pretty bad. I think we're close.
</dd>,<dd><b>Gunther</b>: Yeah! Can't you hear my intense drumming?
</dd>,<dd><b>Princess Bubblegum</b>: Magic Man?

</dd>,<dd><b>Simon Petrikov</b>: Betty, please, what are you doing?
</dd>,<dd><b>Betty (A.I.)</b>: I'm re-programming the crown's wish magic. Got to fix Simon. A-ha!
</dd>,<dd><b>Gunther</b>: I'm a bush!
</dd>,<dd><b>Marceline</b>: It's just on backwards.
</dd>,<dd><b>Princess Bubblegum</b>: Betty's the one who's backwards. We got to get her malware out of here before she causes irreparable damage.
</dd>,<dd><b>Princess Bubblegum</b>: Now!
</dd>,<dd><b>Princess Bubblegum</b>: Now!
</dd>,<dd><b>Marceline</b>: Hoo!
</dd>,<dd><b>Princess Bubblegum</b>: Now! Aaah!
</dd>,<dd><b>Simon Petrikov</b>: There has to be a part of the real Betty in there somewhere, Gunther. If only I could reach out to her.
</dd>,<dd><b>Gunther</b>: Okay. Get in there and reach.
</dd>,<dd><b>Simon</b>: I think I will. Betty? I'm the reason you're doing all this.
</dd>,<dd><b>Betty (A.I.)</b>: I'm busy.
</dd>,<dd><b>Simon Petrikov</b>: Remember how we met? When we both reached for the same book in the library, and I said you should check it out first? And when you returned it, you left a note inside, because you knew I'd borrow it next? It was the funniest, smartest note I've ever read.
</dd>,<dd><b>Betty (A.I.)</b>: I have to work.
</dd>,<dd><b>Simon Petrikov</b>: Betty, I love you so much, but you can't help me like this.

</dd>,<dd><b>Simon Petrikov</b>: You remember me!
</dd>,<dd><b>Betty (A.I.)</b>: I-I

</dd>,<dd><b>Betty (A.I.)</b>: Simon?
</dd>,<dd><b>Simon Petrikov</b>: Betty! I can't believe it's really you!
</dd>,<dd><b>Betty (A.I.)</b>: Technically I'm a magical A.I. avatar derived from Betty's memories.
</dd>,<dd><b>Simon Petrikov</b>: Close enough!
</dd>,<dd><b>Princess Bubblegum</b>: Shwang! The system appears to be stabilizing. Crown shields are coming back online.
</dd>,<dd><b>Marceline</b>: What does that mean?
</dd>,<dd><b>Princess Bubblegum</b>: The crown will re-seal itself off from foreign entities.
</dd>,<dd><b>Marceline</b>: But I-I can come back and visit Simon, right?
</dd>,<dd><b>Princess Bubblegum</b>: No.
</dd>,<dd><b>Betty (A.I.)</b>: What about me?
</dd>,<dd><b>Princess Bubblegum</b>: Don't freak out, but you're gonna be deleted.

</dd>,<dd><b>Marceline</b>: Bye, dude. I'm gonna be nicer to penguins from now on.
</dd>,<dd><b>Gunther</b>: Okay. Wait, what?
</dd>,<dd><b>Marceline</b>: Whoa.
</dd>,<dd><b>Betty (A.I.)</b>: Before I go, there's something I have to tell you.
</dd>,<dd><b>Simon Petrikov</b>: Tell me, Betty.
</dd>,<dd><b>Betty (A.I.)</b>: I-I-I-I-I-I-I-I
</dd>,<dd><b>Simon Petrikov</b>: Betty!
</dd>,<dd><b>Princess Bubblegum</b>: I'm seeing remnants of Betty's program in the readouts. It's like her data left a shadow print on the circuitry.
</dd>,<dd><b>Simon Petrikov</b>: So, what was that thing you were gonna tell me?
</dd>,<dd><b>Betty (A.I.)</b>: I just said that for drama. I figured it would drive you crazy, but at least you'd never stop thinking about me.
</dd>,<dd><b>Simon Petrikov</b>: Betty, I never could.
</dd>,<dd><b>Betty (A.I.)</b>: Mwah!
</dd>,<dd><b>Marceline</b>: I don't see anything. These are just weird dots to me.
</dd>,<dd><b>Ice King</b>: My place is trashed and I can't remember a thing. Great dinner party?

</dd>,<dd><b>Finn</b>: First, we have to expose the traitor's deception. Ah-hah! That's a counterfeit crown, from the liar's own box flesh. Hmm... it looks like your crown was torn off by some... [<i>Places hand on torn area</i>]

</dd>,<dd><b>Finn</b>: Your crown was lost, you say?
</dd>,<dd><b>Box Prince</b>: [<i>Walks towards some plants, and starts circling one of them.</i>]
</dd>,<dd><b>Finn</b>: During a storm? The same storm that sent you hurling through the woods? Until you were delivered into my door step? Right... so it's definitely in the woods somewhere. All we have to do is find your crown to prove to your people that you're the real prince.

</dd>,<dd><b>Jake</b>: Eh, garden stuff, I guess.
</dd>,<dd><b>Finn</b>: Ummm... Hey Bonnie, you always act like a loner, right? But next to your brother, you're the light of the party. Sorry, the LIGHT of the party.
</dd>,<dd><b>Princess Bubblegum</b>: I mean, yeah. One of the first things I did after making sure Neddy was safe was to start making the candy people. I was formed in the Mother Gum. My mind and my gum were in touch with dozens of others, like a crowded womb. I guess I missed that.
</dd>,<dd><b>Jake</b>: But Neddy's from the same place you're from, and he's a wet hot dog around everyone.
</dd>,<dd><b>Princess Bubblegum</b>: People get built different. We don't need to figure it out. We just need to respect it. Maybe he likes his own company better than I like mine.
</dd>,<dd><b>Finn</b>: Well, do you miss the candy people?
</dd>,<dd><b>Princess Bubblegum</b>: [<i>shrug</i>]
</dd>,<dd><b>King of Ooo</b>: Hey babaloos, good thing that juice is back on. I was making a mint, but hoo doggie, my candles were starting to turn. [<i>laughing</i>] Thanks, Jake. [<i>showering in the juice</i>] Ahh, that's the stuff. Hey, do you know if I can drink this? Like, is it like well water? Good for bathing, but not so good for drinking? You know what? I'm going for it! [<i>spitting and coughing out the juice</i>] Yup, it tastes just like you'd think.

</dd>,<dd><b>Finn</b>: [<i>screams</i>] [<i>pants</i>] Huh? [<i>unzips sleeping bag, finding the sword in his hand</i>]

</dd>,<dd>[<i>He runs outside and shrieks, swinging the sword around in an attempt to get it off. He runs into the forest and bites some of it off, but it grows back. He covers his left hand with his pajamas and manages to pull it off his right hand.</i>]
</dd>,<dd><b>Finn</b>: [<i>sighs</i>] Jeez.
</dd>,<dd>[<i>The sword extends its grassy hands toward him, trying to reattach itself. Finn drops it and kicks it toward a cliff.</i>]

</dd>,<dd><b>Finn</b>: [<i>gasps</i>] [<i>looks at his arm, seeing no sword</i>] Whew.
</dd>,<dd>[<i>In the bathroom, he brushes his teeth and opens the cabinet for some floss. As he closes it, he sees the sword behind him in the mirror, still dripping wet.</i>]

</dd>,<dd><b>Finn</b>: [<i>catches it and throws it back</i>] School! [<i>kicks him</i>] Hyah!
</dd>,<dd>[<i>Jake runs by chasing two more hooligans.</i>]
</dd>,<dd><b>Hooligans</b>: Aah! Stop chasing us!
</dd>,<dd>[<i>Finn continues fighting, then rests, panting. A hooligan holding a candle comes up from behind.</i>]
</dd>,<dd><b>Hooligan</b>: Happy birthday. [<i>bashes Finn's head with candle</i>]
</dd>,<dd>[<i>Finn falls to the ground and holds his head. He looks up to see five of the hooligans upon him.</i>]
</dd>,<dd><b>Hooligan</b>: [<i>brandishing candle</i>] You're dead, teddy boy.
</dd>,<dd>[<i>Finn looks down to see the sword wrapped around his wrist again.</i>]
</dd>,<dd><b>Finn</b>: No.
</dd>,<dd>[<i>The hooligan lifts the candle above his head in slow motion, coming in for another hit, but Finn quickly gets up and slices at the candle multiple times. The candle falls apart in the shape of Finn's face. While the hooligans are taken aback, Finn leaps over them while slicing at their hair. After he lands, their hair falls off and they run away screaming.</i>]
</dd>,<dd><b>Suzy &amp; Sue</b>: You've saved our shop!
</dd>,<dd><b>Sue</b>: Thank you so much, you brave young man.
</dd>,<dd><b>Suzy</b>: And don't even worry about the damages.

</dd>,<dd><b>Suzy</b>: Oh, and we'll put it right by the entrance, and it'll be our mascot—the candle man!
</dd>,<dd>[<i>The sword grips Finn's wrist tightly.</i>]
</dd>,<dd><b>Jake</b>: Dude... [<i>winces</i>]
</dd>,<dd><b>Finn</b>: Yeah... not comin' off.
</dd>,<dd><b>Jake</b>: Don't give up, man. Hey, maybe Choose Goose knows where the old man went.
</dd>,<dd>[<i>The scene changes to them walking up to Choose Goose's stall.</i>]
</dd>,<dd><b>Jake</b>: Hey, Choogles! We need your help. We gotta find the dude who sold us this cursed sword. You know who he is?
</dd>,<dd><b>Choose Goose</b>: I know you did business with some rando guy. Help you backstabbers—Why should I?
</dd>,<dd><b>Jake</b>: What? Come on, Choogie, it was only one time.
</dd>,<dd><b>Choose Goose</b>: Hmm.
</dd>,<dd>[<i>Finn slices at a fly, but knocks down some of Choose Goose's wares.</i>]
</dd>,<dd><b>Finn</b>: I made a mistake, CG. This merch is totally defective. [<i>earnestly</i>] Please.
</dd>,<dd><b>Choose Goose</b>: Okay-dokay... I know that quack with the grassy shack. He's a <a href=""/wiki/Grassy_Wizard"" title=""Grassy Wizard"">wizard from the grassy plain</a>. He lives atop the grassy moun... tayn.

</dd>,<dd><b>Finn</b>: Yeah, thanks!
</dd>,<dd>[<i>Finn and Jake start walking off.</i>]
</dd>,<dd><b>Choose Goose</b>: [<i>shouting after them</i>] He's the only one who can lift the curse, but beware...
</dd>,<dd>[<i>Finn and Jake stop in their tracks and turn around.</i>]
</dd>,<dd><b>Choose Goose</b>: He's a huge ding-wad—just the worst.
</dd>,<dd>[<i>The scene switches to Finn and Jake running toward the grassy mountain. Suddenly, some grass monsters emerge from the side of the hill. Finn slices the head off each one as he runs by.</i>]
</dd>,<dd><b>Finn</b>: Chop, chop, chop, chop, chop!
</dd>,<dd>[<i>In front of them, a giant <a href=""/wiki/Grass_Bear"" title=""Grass Bear"">Grass Bear</a> grows out of the ground. It growls and spits at them and steps toward Jake.</i>]
</dd>,<dd><b>Jake</b>: [<i>screams</i>]
</dd>,<dd>[<i>Finn gets Jake out of the way of the monster's foot and slices its leg in the shape of his face without even looking. The monster howls while balancing on one foot. Finn flicks the blade of his sword, causing it to rapidly spin like a propeller. The monster spits at them some more, then collapses on top of them. Finn uses the sword to blast his way out from under the mound of grass. The blade stops spinning and they continue up the mountain.</i>]
</dd>,<dd><b>Finn</b>: Hmm. For a cursed dingus, you cut so good.
</dd>,<dd>[<i>They reach the shack at the top of the mountain.</i>]
</dd>,<dd><b>Finn</b>: Come forth, wizard, and uncurse my mitt! Grassy Mountain Wizard!
</dd>,<dd>[<i>The door opens and out steps the guy who sold Finn his sword. He casts aside his cloak and sunglasses.</i>]

</dd>,<dd><b>Grassy Wizard</b>: [<i>laughs</i>] Never! You have no power over me, young fool! The grass sword will be part of you for all eternity! [<i>laughs</i>]
</dd>,<dd><b>Finn</b>: [<i>contemplates for a moment</i>] Hmm. You know what? [<i>backs off from wizard</i>] I think I'm cool with that.
</dd>,<dd>[<i>The sword retracts and wraps around Finn's arm.</i>]

</dd>,<dd>[<i>Finn then grabs Jake and contemplates what he’s about to do. He looks a bit concerned. Lady and Mr. Cupcake are kissing and Finn puts Jake right in front of them. Jake doesn’t notice, but Finn moves his head around to see them. Then Jake starts yelling “wah”. Mr. Cupcake drops Lady and she acts with indignation towards Jake. Jake argues back and then Mr. Cupcake starts yelling at Jake. Jake pushes him and Lady pleads that they not fight. Finn looks towards the bag and then looks back with realization. He empties out the bag. The scene ends.</i>]

</dd>,<dd><b>Jake</b>:  [<i>Comes back to the table with a drink in a mug</i>] You stay up all night readin’ trash books? [<i>Finn makes a weak “meh” sound.</i>] I told you, man. Those datin’ books. [<i>Sips drink</i>] That stuff is mess you up. [<i>Drinks again</i>]
</dd>,<dd><b>Finn</b>:  I’m not reading. I’m playing with the little wees.

</dd>,<dd><b>Finn</b>:  Uh, you guys broke up.
</dd>,<dd><b>Jake</b>:  [<i>Confused</i>] Wha?
</dd>,<dd><b>Finn</b>:  She’s with someone else now.
</dd>,<dd><b>Jake</b>:  [<i>Angry</i>] <i>Who</i>?!
</dd>,<dd><b>Finn</b>:  He’s a cool guy, don’t worry about it.
</dd>,<dd><b>Jake</b>:  [<i>Hears Lady laughing and goes to the source. He finds little Finn in Lady’s lap kissing under a book teepee</i>] Ahhhhhh! [<i>Slams his fists on the table</i>] What the ball, man?!
</dd>,<dd><b>Finn</b>:  [<i>Laughs and shrugs; he doesn’t sound as worn out as before</i>] What?
</dd>,<dd><b>Jake</b>:  <i>What</i>? What do ya think “what”?!
</dd>,<dd><b>Finn</b>:  Come on, they’re not real, they’re like toys. These guys here, they’re goin’ out. [<i>Points the Marceline and <a href=""/wiki/Peppermint_Butler"" title=""Peppermint Butler"">Peppermint Butler</a> in a tea cup.

</dd>,<dd><b>Jake</b>:  [<i>slowly backs towards the exit</i>] I don’t like where you’re going with this. It ain’t wholesome. I’m gonna go to Lady’s for a few days. To clear my head. [<i>Leaves</i>]
</dd>,<dd><b>Finn</b>:  Okay. Whatever whatevs. [<i>Goes over to little Finn and Lady and chuckles</i>] Weird. [<i>Grabs little Finn and Flame Princess</i>] Huh?
</dd>,<dd>[<i>Finn puts both of them near each other, but nothing happens. Finn breaks off part of a cookie and puts in on little Finn’s head. He grabs it and Flame Princess yawns. Finn uses a pencil to move little Finn’s legs to walk towards Flame Princess. Flame Princess is pleasantly surprised to see little Finn and giggles. Little Finn breaks part of the cookie crumb off and gives it to Flame Princess. They then start to eat each end of what’s left. Lady comes out of her teepee to see little Finn and Flame Princess and starts crying hysterically</i>]
</dd>,<dd>[<i>Finn then drops Princess Bubblegum in between Flame Princess and little Finn. At first they awkwardly stand around, but Finn moves Princess Bubblegum’s hand onto little Finn’s shoulder. She begins massaging his shoulders and he likes it. Real Finn looks around nervously to make sure no one can see what he’s doing. Then they kiss and Flame Princess is outraged. She begins yelling at Princess Bubblegum and Princess Bubblegum yells back. Little Finn tries to diffuse the situation, but Flame Princess leaps onto Princess Bubblegum. Princess Bubblegum’s dress catches on fire so she runs away into Lady’s teepee. Using Lady as a kind of hose, the water being her tears, Princess Bubblegum partially extinguishes Flame Princess. They begin fighting and real Finn is astonished and begins blushing.</i>]

</dd>,<dd><b>Jake</b>:  What’s little Finn doing?
</dd>,<dd><b>Finn</b>:  He’s... thinking.
</dd>,<dd><b>Jake</b>:  [<i>Looks concerned</i>] He looks sad. What’s he thinking about?

</dd>,<dd><b>Jake</b>:  Where’s little Rainicorn?
</dd>,<dd><b>Finn</b>:  Probably still crying.

</dd>,<dd><b>Finn</b>:  She’s not handling the break-up very well.
</dd>,<dd><b>Jake</b>:  [<i>sees Lady still crying in her teepee</i>] Aww.
</dd>,<dd><b>Finn</b>:  PB's good, though. [<i>Princess Bubblegum is on a weight bench lifting weights and she has become very toned. She looks very angry.</i>] After little Finn dumped her, she started working out. Looks like she’s really into it.
